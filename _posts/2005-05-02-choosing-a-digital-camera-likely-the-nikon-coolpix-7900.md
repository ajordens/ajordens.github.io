I should prefix by a statement that I&#8217;m not a photographer. I don&#8217;t really take random pictures of flowers or the girl next door. However, I&#8217;m a technoph  
ile and like my toys.

I feel its time to replace my crappy old school digital camera (which at least had 3x optical zoom) with something a little better. I haven&#8217;t really set a  
n upper bounds on what I&#8217;d be willing to spend, but after doing a bit of looking (influenced by my girlfriends father) I&#8217;ve decided to go Nikon. 

In particular I&#8217;m thinking about the Coolpix 7900. It&#8217;s not going to break the bank but should provide me with a decent starting point. Plus it&#8217;s compati  
ble with an underwater case. The later is an accessory that I&#8217;d probably pickup if I were to head back to Mexico (I just got back from vacationing down th  
ere last week and unfortunately the 7900 + waterproof case wasn&#8217;t available).

I don&#8217;t want a particularly large camera, it would be nice to go better than 3x optical zoom but at 7MP&#8217;s maybe I can do a little photoshop magic. 

Summer&#8217;s on its way so I&#8217;ll be ordering the camera in the next few days. I&#8217;ve included the specifications below.
