> &#8220;The developers at del.icio.us have announced that they were purchased by Yahoo!. From the post: &#8216;We&#8217;re proud to announce that del.icio.us has joined the Yahoo! family. Together we&#8217;ll continue to improve how people discover, remember and share on the Internet, with a big emphasis on the power of community. We&#8217;re excited to be working with the Yahoo! Search team &#8211; they definitely get social systems and their potential to change the web. (We&#8217;re also excited to be joining our fraternal twin Flickr!)'&#8221; For background on this purchase, carre4 writes &#8220;Stuart Maxwell, Jeff Barr, and Yahoo! team&#8217;s Jeremy Zawodny recently did an interview explaining What&#8217;s so cool about del.icio.us, in which Jeremy gave a non-committal answer about Yahoo acquiring del.ico.us&#8221;
