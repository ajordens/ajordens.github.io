Yesterday was Canada Day.

As is a usual activity on July 1st, I attended a friends bbq for a few hours yesterday afternoon. It was a pretty casual affair, I ended up driving, parking on a side street and walking down. A few hours later I walked back to my car only to see that the front driver&#8217;s side fender had been hit and the front bumper cracked and partially removed. I called the cops and explained that my car had been involved in a hit &#038; run (albeit a minor one) but they wanted nothing to do with it, instead referring me to ICBC. After talking with ICBC, I&#8217;ve now got an appointment to see a claims adjuster in a weeks time. After that, I&#8217;ll have to make an appointment with a body repair shop.

It&#8217;s also no consolation that I&#8217;ll have to pay the insurance deductable and drive around in a smashed up VW for at least another couple weeks. I&#8217;ll post some pictures once I&#8217;ve pulled them from my camera.

A few years back I had another problem on Canada Day. I woke up early in the morning and walked out to my car only to see doors opened and a couple thousand dollars in stereo equipment stolen.

From now on I think it&#8217;ll be best if I sleep in my car every July 1st <img src="http://littlesquare.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
