If you live this side of Mars, you&#8217;ve heard of Flickr.

If you have a dog, you&#8217;ve probably already published a Flickr hack and have it listed [here][1].

[Jeff Atwood][2] has written a short piece on [flickr hacks][3] and includes a brief summary of some pretty cool extensions to the Flickr API. 

I must admit, many of them are pretty slick.
