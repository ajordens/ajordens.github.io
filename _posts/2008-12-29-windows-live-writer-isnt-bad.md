Until recently, the bulk of my writing was done on a Mac using Ecto.&#160; 

I was looking for a suitable publishing tool for Windows and was directed towards [Windows Live Writer][1].

Short answer, it’s nice.&#160; I’ve installed the **2009: Release Candidate** and published to WordPress with no problems whatsoever.&#160;
