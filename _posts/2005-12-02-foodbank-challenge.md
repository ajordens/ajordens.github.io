Last week marked the completion of the annual [VIATec foodbank challenge][1].

**What&#8217;s The Foodbank Challenge?**

> Join the tech community to show the kind of difference we can make!
> 
> Once again we are pitting technology company against technology company in an effort to raise as much food and donations as possible for the Mustard Seed Food Bank in time for Christmas.
> 
> It&#8217;s easy! Bring your food donations to a secured storage room at the Vancouver Island Technology Park every Friday in November. The Challenge will recognise both the company that donates the most food overall, as well as the company that donates the most per employee. Participants will be thanked and the winners announced at VIATeCâ€™s Christmas Reception &#8211; date and location TBA. 

Basically, all the local technology companies compete against each other to see who can raise the most &#8216;points&#8217; for the foodbank. Points are determine per donated food item with in-demand items being worth more points.

This year GenoLogics put in a tremendous showing with a contribution of over 12000 points. We did our best to optimize our points per dollar but that still amounted to a $3000 or $4000 food donation. Not bad for a 30-odd person startup. 

Final results won&#8217;t be released until the VIATec christmas party this week, but with any luck we&#8217;ll come out on top.

Well done guys. It&#8217;s nice to see everyone come together and support such a good cause.
