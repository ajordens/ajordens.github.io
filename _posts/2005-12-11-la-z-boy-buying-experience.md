So yesterday I went into the local La-Z-Boy furniture gallery to look at buying a nice chair.

My requirements weren&#8217;t that great, with the only one being the ability to put the chair close to the wall and have it recline fully.

After about 45 minutes of lounging, I selected a nice chair that their computer system said was in stock. Great because there&#8217;s a 10 week delay on special orders for any item not in stock.

Everything was going well until they couldn&#8217;t find the chair that was *supposedly* in their warehouse.

I spent a good couple hours in their store eating a couple of cookies and wandering around aimlessly while they searched for the chair. Needless to say it wasn&#8217;t found and I went home empty handed and disappointed. 

My recommendation to La-Z-Boy and the gallery, get an inventory system that works. I&#8217;m not the kind of person that&#8217;s willing to wait 10weeks for a special order so there&#8217;s a good chance that they&#8217;ve lost my business.
