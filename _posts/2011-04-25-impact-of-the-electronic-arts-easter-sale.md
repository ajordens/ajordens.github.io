I just finished a quick analysis on the overall impact to Electronic Arts of this past weekends 99c sale.

The follow data has been pulled from the Top Paid US iPhone and iPad charts.

 

Prior to the sale, EA had a total of **five** ranked iPad applications (Tiger Woods, Boogle, Scrabble, Max and the Magic Marker, and Monopoly).

The highest ranking iPad application was Max and the Magic Marker at **31st** spot.

 

With regards to the iPhone, EA had a total of **ten** ranked applications (NBA Jam, The Sims, Scrabble, Battlefield, NBA Elite, Tetris, Tiger Woods, Mortal Kombat, The Game of Life, and Monopoly).

The highest ranking iPhone application was NBA Elite at **28th** spot.

 

In terms of pricing, the average prices for EA iPhone and iPad applications pre-sale was **> $2.99**.  During the sale, most applications were dropped to **99c**. The few apps that didn&#8217;t receive a price cut maintained their chart positions but didn&#8217;t make any gains.

 

As of today (2011-04-25), Electronic Arts has **fifteen **iPad applications and **twenty-two** iPhone applications on the top 100 charts.

Many of these applications had fallen off the charts in the weeks and months prior to this sale.

 

10 of the top 20 paid and 3 of the top 20 **grossing** applications (iPhone) now belong to EA.

Looking at the iPad, it&#8217;s even more exaggerated with EA controlling 7 of the top 10 paid and 4 of the top 20 **grossing** applications.

 

This is big business and Electronic Arts are one of the masters when it comes to timely price manipulations.

We, as consumers, are extremely price sensitive.
