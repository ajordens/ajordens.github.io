Caught the announcement on CBC last week regarding Microsoft&#8217;s intention to start a development centre in nearby Vancouver, BC.

It&#8217;s funny that they mention troubles with US immigration as being a motivating factor for opening shop this side of the border. I don&#8217;t doubt it, but when I was dealing with Amazon.com last year, they seemed to indicate that it wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem to get me a TN (and later a H-1B) visa should I want to work south of the border.

If MS wanted to extend their reach a little further, they&#8217;d consider situating the centre downtown with easy access to float planes. I&#8217;m sure there are more than a few talented individuals on the island who wouldn&#8217;t mind a slight commute.

I&#8217;m curious as to what technologies and product&#8217;s they plan on shifting resources up here for, or if the focus will be more R&D. 

What&#8217;s the likelihood of this being just the start of a trend for larger software shops to setup more substantial operations north of the border?
