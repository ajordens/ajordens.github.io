> Debate sprang up at JAOO &#8217;07 around Bob Martin&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;nowadays it is irresponsible for a developer to ship a line of code he has not executed in a unit test.&#8221; In this InfoQ video, he debated with Jim Coplien on this and other topics, including Design by Contract vs. TDD and how much up-front architecture is needed to keep a system consistent with the business domain model.
