If I had a Wii and smashed my plasma TV up like this poor [fellow][1]?

<a id="I214" onclick="if(true)toggleImage(214);else alert('There is no thumbnail associated with this photo.');return false;" href="javascript:void()"><img width="128" height="96" alt="Broken TV" id="image214" src="http://www.jordens.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/wiibreak3.jpg" /></a>

Actually it wouldn&#8217;t be&#8230; but that still doesn&#8217;t necessarily stop me from picking one up once they&#8217;re a little more accessible. But first I&#8217;m still pretty keen on picking up a mod&#8217;d XBox and using it as a media center (with the High Definition AV pack).
