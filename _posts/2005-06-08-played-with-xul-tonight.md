I got an IM today from a friend and former colleague who works for a company (not to be mentioned here) that develops software incorporating substantial use of XUL. Besides the recruitment offer, I was intrigued with their usage of XUL. In their case, XUL makes perfect platform sense and is a necessicity but that&#8217;s a point for future discussion. 

To date I&#8217;ve had only a cursory understanding and interest in XUL. Conceptually it&#8217;s pretty cool but until tonight I had never taken the time to look a little bit under the hood. So I&#8217;ve spent the last few hours working through a few tutorials getting a grip on the general GUI design/layout aspects. No real brain science here and it&#8217;s quite trivial to throw together a nice looking UI. 

Yesterday I downloaded Visual C# Express 2005 and built a little app that connected to GMail and would read my messages to me. Pretty simple and C# is on my list of languages to brush up on, shouldn&#8217;t be a big deal given my day in &#8211; day out exposure to Java. Now if only Microsoft provided some better voices in SAPI. I&#8217;ll upgrade to SAPI 5.1 but I doubt it&#8217;ll improve matters. 

Tonight was XUL, and who knows what the rest of the week will bring. I like the challenge that picking up new technologies presents and I&#8217;m going to try and dedicate more time to it when outside of the office. Immediate plans for further XUL exposure is the cloning of a few existing native application user interfaces. Shouldn&#8217;t pose that big of a challenge but at the same time will force exposure to the entire XUL specification.
