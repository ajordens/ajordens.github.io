*&#8220;If I had to perform all future maintenance on this code, would I be happy?&#8221;*  
**or**  
*&#8220;Would Person X still be my friend if I left them to maintain this code?&#8221;*

I&#8217;ve been thinking recently about motivating developers to write good (ie. maintainable) code. 

We all know how easy it is to fire and forget&#8230; moving from project to project, leaving maintenance to the next guy. Why would I want to worry about nitty gritty things like unit tests or encapsulation when I can crank out dialogs and widgets day in and day out. Well&#8230; what if new development stopped and all that was left was maintenance or enhancement of the existing code base? It&#8217;d probably be a difficult transition.

In my opinion, it takes a seasoned (or perhaps dedicated is a better word) developer to realize the importance of quality and the implications of not considering maintainability in your designs. It&#8217;s one thing to recognize the importance of quality and another thing to actually make correct decisions to achieve it.

Some people have a knack for it, but not everyone. The difficult thing (yet critically important) is encouraging the development of these skills and ensuring that maintainability and quality don&#8217;t fall by the wayside.

That&#8217;s enough from me. Back to your regularly scheduled program.
