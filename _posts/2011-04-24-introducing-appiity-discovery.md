The manners in which applications are discovered has been a particular passion of mine for awhile now.

About a year ago, I started collecting the data to drive the site that has eventually morphed into [Appiity][1].

If you haven&#8217;t seen it, Appiity is an application that enhances the iTunes App Store charts with historical information about each application.  It answers the questions: &#8216;Does this app have staying power or is it a one hit wonder?&#8217; or &#8216;Does this vendor have a history of releasing quality applications or do they just manipulate their prices enough to maintain a particular rank?&#8217;.

 

Over the past month or so, I&#8217;ve been looking to make application discovery a little more personal.  I believe that finding great applications is an inherently social activity. We&#8217;re more likely to try an application recommended by friends than one with a significant advertising budget.

With that, I&#8217;m proud to announce that my latest experiment is ready for a bit more public attention.

[Appiity Discover][2]

It&#8217;s still very much a work in progress, but for those of you wanting to help improve application discovery, check it out.

Appiity Discover aims to help you find better applications through the development of a personal profile. This profile defines who you are and the types of applications you have indicated a preference for.

  We realize that this goal cannot be accomplished overnight and hope that this first incarnation will be a stepping stone towards realizing our goals.

In the meantime, we hope you&#8217;re willing to help us out. In return, we&#8217;ll do our best to help you find that golden nugget of an app that would have otherwise been missed.
