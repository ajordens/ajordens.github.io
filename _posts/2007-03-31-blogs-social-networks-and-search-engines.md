  <em>Ignore the fact that this post is about me searching for myself on Google.&nbsp; Everybody does it.</em>

  I&rsquo;ve noticed a slight change in some of the search (Google & Yahoo) results.
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  The top results are now starting to include public profiles for various online services.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m talking about Flickr, Facebook, LinkedIn, Feedburner, etc.&nbsp;
</p>

  Also included are personal blogs and depending on the search engine, particular postings.

  There&rsquo;s a lot of information held in each of these services, so it&rsquo;s nice to see at least an entry point to each showing up.&nbsp; I suppose with a bit of <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/">grease</a>, you could incorporate these results with more detailed information using each services API.&nbsp;

  Intentional or not, I think it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally it would be&nbsp;as automated as possible, so something like <a href="http://www.wink.com/">Wink</a>&nbsp;may not be all that appropriate (it&rsquo;s interesting tho).&nbsp; 173,814,621 people indexed and only a LinkedIn entry for me.&nbsp; At least it&rsquo;s indexing LinkedIn and MySpace.&nbsp;

  Most of us go out of our way to prevent our email addresses from being indexed, but it would be nice if I could search (effectively) by email address (Yahoo did at least returned results for email addresses).&nbsp; Data privacy concerns aside, Google&nbsp;has a lot of information already and could easily do a mapping between email address and name.&nbsp; Or even for searches being performed by me, use the information from my address book as additional context.
