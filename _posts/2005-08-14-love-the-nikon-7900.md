Couple things, I&#8217;ve had about a 150 images on my flash card for sometime now and have finally uploaded them to [Flickr][1]. One of these days I&#8217;ll create some more actual image sets in Organizr but until then you&#8217;re on your own.

The first set is from Victoria&#8217;s Symphony Splash event (fireworks included) that occured a few weeks back, and the second set is from the Parksville Sandcastle competition that finished up last weekend.

I&#8217;ve only had my Nikon 7900 for about 5 or 6 months but I absolutely love it. As you can tell by my picture taking abilities, I&#8217;m not a photographer by any stretch of the imagination (I&#8217;m a total point and clicker to boot). However, I do like how the fireworks pictures turned out. That was my first attempt at messing with the camera&#8217;s presets.
