I must admit that I don&#8217;t read a lot of books, and even less books when those books are not overly technical in nature (I read > 100 feeds daily and tend to read most technical literature online).

My girlfriend on the other hand reads quite a bit and given that we were going to Mexico for a week, I decided to pickup something to read on the 5hr plane ride.  I had to buy sun glasses so while I was in the mall I walked into a Coles bookstore and picked up [Freakonomics][1].

I didn&#8217;t know what to expect but for some strange reason I&#8217;d heard good things of the book before.  Nevertheless, it&#8217;s a book lacking a real theme (not that I cared one bit) but containing pertinent questions and well articulated answers.  If you&#8217;re interested in the books material, checkout the authors&#8217; [blog][2].  I won&#8217;t reveal any details, but it was definitely a quick read and I read it cover to cover in 3 sittings.

Next on the reading list is Brian Goetz&#8217;s [Java Concurrency in Practice][3].  I picked it up at this years No Fluff Just Stuff but only managed to get 75 or so pages into it on the plane ride back from Puerto Vallarta.  Definitely a slower and more technical read but it&#8217;ll prove it&#8217;s usefulness.  Brian&#8217;s concurrency talks are excellent and the book is doing a good job at filling in the gaps and covering concepts in more detail than 90 minute lectures provide.
