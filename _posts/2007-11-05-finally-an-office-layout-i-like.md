Over the past 4 and a half years I&#8217;ve been part of many moves and office re-organizations.  From my rather brief experience over the past few years, these activities are done with the goal of creating more available space for desks.  It&#8217;s rare that they&#8217;re done with the goal of improving team efficiencies and reducing barriers to communication.

Until now.

This past weekend the development team went through our second (or fourth depending on who&#8217;s counting) office change in the past couple years.  We&#8217;ve moved away from the typical rows of cubicles and are now in fairly spacious pods of 4 or 5 people.  There was even space left over to create a developer lounge with couches, bean bag chairs and a fridge.  They&#8217;re team-centric so you&#8217;ll be sitting with the people that you&#8217;re actively on a project with.  Hopefully less running across the office trying to track down your QA resource.

I must commend the individuals that planned all of this out and actually made it happen.  Today was one of the more productive days I&#8217;ve had in awhile and that&#8217;s after half of it was spent unpacking.  Needless to say it&#8217;s amazing what you can get done when you&#8217;re in a (quiet) environment conducive to coding.

Even better, now that all the developers are more or less in the same area we&#8217;re able to set lighting levels the way we like&#8230; which tend to be a bit darker than your typical non-naturally lit offices.  

I should also mention that we&#8217;re [hiring][1].
