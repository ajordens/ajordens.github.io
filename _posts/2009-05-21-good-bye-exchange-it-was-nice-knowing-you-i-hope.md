I’m happy to say that after a good 3 or 4 years of using Exchange for all our corporate email/calendaring, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

I got an invitation today to join our pilot project on Google Apps for Enterprise.&#160; Awesome, right!?

Is it bad than I’m looking forward to the opportunity to jettison all 35 or 40k emails and start anew?&#160; I’d honestly trade that in an instance to free up the memory and CPU cycles chewed up by Entourage.&#160; 

&#160;

It’ll be interesting to see how it plays out.&#160; It’s still a pilot project so there are a few obvious and annoying gaps that force me back to Entourage, but if we can work out those kinks I’ll sure be a happy camper.&#160; 

*Given that our executives were willing to jump on the iPhone bandwagon from the Blackberry, this idea could actually fly.*

&#160;

I’d be curious to hear from any small to mid-sized companies (*we’re in the 75-100 employee range*) that have made similar transitions.
