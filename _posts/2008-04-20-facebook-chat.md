So it looks like the Facebook Chat service has finally started rolling out to my network (<span style="font-style: italic;">Facebook Chat has been mentioned</span> [<span style="font-style: italic;">previously</span>)][1].

Not quite sure how I feel about it yet. I don&#8217;t really need yet another IM solution (<span style="font-style: italic;">beyond Twitter, MSN & Jabber/GTalk</span>) so it&#8217;s very unlikely that I&#8217;m going to be consistently keeping a Facebook tab open just for this.

We&#8217;ll see what the future holds, who knows, maybe they&#8217;ll hook it up to XMPP and someone will build an interface for one of the IM tools I&#8217;m already using. Even then it&#8217;s debatable how big a role it&#8217;ll play in my personal communications.
