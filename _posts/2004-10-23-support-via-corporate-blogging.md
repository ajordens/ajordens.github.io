I agree. If you&#8217;re in a (commodity? I&#8217;m not a biker) market like Kryptonite, I don&#8217;t think you can afford to limit your corporate presence. 

One mistake combined with a slowness to react and take responsiblity could seriously hurt a company. If I was a biker, why would I want to buy a Kryptonit  
e lock? Even if I could be assured that my lock is secure, I wouldn&#8217;t feel comfortable with the company and their ability to handle any future problems.  
Slowness to get the information out, inability to handle customer communication.

Luckily, I think that the bike stores (at least the ones around here), stepped up to the plate and supported their customers. A small store shouldn&#8217;t be  
responsible for damage control but in order to stay afloat they were forced to support their customers. Why should this be any different for a larger corp  
oration?

Bottom line, you want to improve your relationship with customers, try including a blog in your communication strategy (and not one of them corporation-fi  
ltered blogs, we need and expect honesty).
