[Scroogle][1]

Just started reading [SiliconBeat][2] and came across scroogle.

Look Mom, it&#8217;s google without the advertisments. 

Personally, I think its ugly and I have no beep with Googles in-search advertisements. I guess this is right up the alley of the google-watch.org support  
ers. The source code for the proxy is available for download from the homepage.
