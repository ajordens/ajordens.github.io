I posted a few days ago about my trials and tribulations surrounding buying a home.

Turns out that everything worked out in the end and I&#8217;m now (assuming subject to&#8217;s come off) the owner of a new townhouse.

I&#8217;m not looking forward to moving, but it&#8217;ll be nice to have a place of my own.Â  I&#8217;ll only have to deal with lawyers, bankers and real estate agents for another month or two now.  
Again, the real winners in all of this&#8230; the *real estate agents *(but followed closely by the bankers and laywers).*
