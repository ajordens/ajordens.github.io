Saw another interesting post over on DZone aptly titled *[Changes Are Expensive, Damn Expensive][1]*.

Now I agree more or less with the premise of the argument.  There will always be a cost associated with writing or releasing code, invariably this cost will rise as the product matures in the market and develops a sizable customer base.  Not only do market demands or shifts dictate the cost of a change (or conversely it&#8217;s earning potential) but the organization itself plays a significant role in determining the true cost of a change.

The developer in me doesn&#8217;t necessary agree with the notion that code re-use should significant increase the cost of a change.  We&#8217;ve all been beat over the head with the *low coupling &#8211; high cohesion* hammer enough to hopefully understand when and how code should be re-used. 

In my mind, it&#8217;s all about timing and more importantly becoming pro-active individuals.  The later ties into the act of balancing both the strategic and tactical objectives of an organization.  Having been through the high growth periods of a startup, I&#8217;ve come to realize the importance of establishing strategic goals (*we didn&#8217;t exactly have them and played catch-up long after the fact*).  In times of pressure it&#8217;s very easy to forget the future and plan only for the present. 

> *A lot of software companies have realized this, and they provide a test suite along with the code that they handover to their customers.*

I&#8217;m not quite sure what kind of software the author writes (I realize he&#8217;s in India so perhaps it&#8217;s outsourced work) but short of open-source projects I&#8217;ve rarely ever seen code let alone a test suite delivered to an end-user.  An interesting idea but difficult I imagine to do in practice with a diverse set of customers and demands.  As a user of software, it&#8217;s been long evident that writing test cases doesn&#8217;t guarantee quality software nor ease of maintenance.  It shows a bit of added diligence and with the right team could take you a significant ways towards building maintainable software *but* **unfortunately **it&#8217;s not a guarantee of anything.

The act of making a change impacts far more organizational groups then development, certainly if it&#8217;s any way shape or form user-facing.  Not to be left out would be the customer support, quality assurance and end-user documentation costs associated with any significant change in functionality.

Changes are inevitable and when *adequately balanced* an important aspect of growth.  Probably the worst thing a developing (or already established) organization can do is attempt to ignore them. Fortunately for us we&#8217;ve be witness to an emergence of organizational processes (some development-focused, some not) that should allow us to more easily embrace the notion of change.
