Only in Victoria I say.

It&#8217;s not often that I find out something that&#8217;s happening locally from a site like Slashdot. But this [article][1] is saying that we&#8217;re getting urinals that rise automagically from the ground. Supposed to curb our rampant practice of peeing in public and for a mere pittance of $75,000. What barbarians we are!
