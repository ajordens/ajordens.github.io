I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of switching themes for a little while now.

This weekend I bit the bullet and installed the [2813][1] theme (and upgraded WordPress along the way).

We&#8217;ll see how it goes, I may just end up switching back to Contempt if the minimalist look doesn&#8217;t grow on me.
