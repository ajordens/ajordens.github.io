> 59% of companies say they won&#8217;t be giving out holiday bonuses in any form 2005. And of those that will, only 13% said they will be giving out bonuses in cash, [Hewitt Associates told CNN][1]. Among the companies that said they would be giving cash, the average holiday bonus planned is $683, but the cash bonuses slated range between $25 and $2,500. 

Interesting&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a good percentage (41% sounds like a good number to me).

I wonder what the numbers are like here in Canada. In my brief working career most of the bonuses I&#8217;ve seen have come in the way of a few extra days off between Christmas and New Years. Cash is always nice, but time off is nothing to shake a fist at.
