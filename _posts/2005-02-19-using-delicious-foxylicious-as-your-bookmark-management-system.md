I&#8217;m toying with the idea of totally using delicious and Foxylicious (the Firefox plug-in) as my bookmark system.

Part of my problem is that I use multiple machines (laptop and desktop at work, couple desktops at home) and I like to have synchronized bookmarks at each.

I&#8217;ve been using delicious for awhile but just haven&#8217;t been in a good habit of assigning proper tags. I&#8217;ve fixed that issue and I think i&#8217;m ready for the j  
ump.

To date I&#8217;ve been using the firefox bookmark synchronizer that works over ftp. It has worked well, but the added benefit of delicious is that I can also l  
og into it over the web. Its trivial to add new items to it and as an asside you get the # of other references to it. Helps give you an idea regarding un  
iqueness of content.

Anyways, I think I&#8217;ll make the switch. Anyone else done the same?
