The past little while I&#8217;ve been planning a [Hack Day][1] for the [company][2] that I work for.

We were originally supposed to hold it a few months back but some project deadlines got in the way and it inevitably got delayed.

However, we&#8217;re in the home stretch and we&#8217;ll actually be holding the event tomorrow, November 24th at our Victoria office. It&#8217;s an internal only event (unlike Yahoo&#8217;s latest endeavor) but it should be a lot of fun. We&#8217;ve managed to get a bit of a budget for it so we&#8217;ll be handing out a few [prizes][3].

Essentially, the goal of this event is to give our developers (and QA/CS/Profession Services, etc.) an opportunity to explore technologies and/or frameworks that they wouldn&#8217;t normally get to deal with in the course of normal work. Everyone has an idea of something cool to do but it&#8217;s a rarity to have the time to actually do something&#8230; we&#8217;re hoping to present that opportunity.

It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how it plays out, I&#8217;m hoping that this is the first of many hack fests.

Time to get back to my Rails hack.
