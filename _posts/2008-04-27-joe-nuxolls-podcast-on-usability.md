Joe&#8217;s talk at the Java Posse Roundup on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=317307">UI Polish and Usability</a></span> has been posted (<span style="font-style: italic;">actually it was posted last month, I&#8217;m just working backwards</span>).

Lots of interesting discussion about formal usability testing and good design in general.

I completely agree with a distinction being made between usability testing, design (information architecture and use cases) and polish. It&#8217;s unfortunate that in the software industry (today), there&#8217;s often an in-balance between the three with polish usually getting the short end of the stick (and Polish != Web 2.0).
