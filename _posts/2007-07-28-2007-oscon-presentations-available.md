I was pretty keen on attending this years OSCON in Portland but it unfortunately didn&#8217;t fit into the conference budget.

It&#8217;s never really a replacement for attending but a good majority of the presentations this year are now available (as PDFs) [here][1].

I haven&#8217;t looked at many yet but there appear to be some fairly interesting talks regarding Java. Not to mention general programming and open-source goodness (ie. Databases Don&#8217;t Matter or Nested Data Parallelism in Haskell). 

Maybe next year!
