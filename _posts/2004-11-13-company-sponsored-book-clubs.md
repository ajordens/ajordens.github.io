We&#8217;ve come up with the idea of having a book club at work.

We&#8217;re still a small company in start-up mode and see such an idea as a way to encourge personal growth and knowledge sharing through the organization.

The book club is going to target both developers and those on the marketing/business side. To start off we&#8217;re going to run two books, [From Good to Great][1] and [Code Complete][2].

I&#8217;ll be leading the developers through Code Complete and we&#8217;ll likely start with the section focusing on Code Improvements. I think its important for all  
developers to have a solid understanding of software quality and what it means for the development process.

It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the idea works out.
