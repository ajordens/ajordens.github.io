Even though I&#8217;m going to Mexico for two weeks tomorrow, I decided to lay it all out and dist-upgrade my perfectly fine installation of warty on my work lap  
top.

I&#8217;m happy to report that it went off without a hitch. Just finished a few more upgrades and will restart X to see if anything breaks, but other than that,  
a success.

Good job ubuntu maintainers!
