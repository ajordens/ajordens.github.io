Can&#8217;t help but comment on the fact that a fellow Victorian won the NBA MVP. Always good to see the underdog pull through.

Congratuations Steve and go Suns!

On the flip side, I also admire Mark Cuban for what he&#8217;s done as a technologist and the type of person he is (his ownership antics are only part of this).  
He&#8217;s one of the best owners in the league and I&#8217;m looking forward to the series, it should be a good one.
