[URLinfo beta || Fagan Finder][1]

Caught a link to this little tool over on Marc Canter&#8217;s [blog][2]. 

URLInfo is a bookmarkletable service that given a URL can return all sorts of information about it. You can get links statistics from most of the blog ind  
exing services (technorati, feedster..etc) from a central location and also single click translation services, validation services and more. Looks like th  
ere&#8217;s over 90 tools in total.

The ability to query to blog sites is nice but I don&#8217;t really have a need for most of the other items. It&#8217;s a pretty cool idea nonetheless.
