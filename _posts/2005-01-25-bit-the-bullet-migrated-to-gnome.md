I don&#8217;t know what caused me to do it, but tonight I finally bit the bullet and made the jump from KDE to Gnome. 

I&#8217;ve been a KDE user for sometime, probably mostly out of laziness. I did switch my work desktop over a couple weeks ago but have been holding over switch  
ing one of my home machines over.

I find gnome to be a slightly cleaner and more efficient interface to use. Other than a few minor usability issues, its not really all that different. I  
have switched the default browser from epiphany to firefox (for plugins) and also use konsole instead of gnome-terminal. I&#8217;ve found that gnome-terminal i  
s fairly slow (an understatement) when scrolling, thus causing significant slowness when starting JBoss..etc. The slowdown is noticable and on the order  
of maginude of 20-25s on a 70-80s startup and deployment cycle.

I remember starting out with fvwm oh so many years ago. Fond memories of running xearth as your desktop background. From there it was a slow migration to  
afterstep/windowmaker and than perhaps a jump to KDE, with a tryout of enlightenment in between. The jump to KDE came about from a distribution change, b  
ut now that I&#8217;ve been running Debian for a couple of years, I haven&#8217;t had a need to re-install or change distributions, thus sticking with KDE. Well no mo  
re. 

[Gnome 2.10][1] looks pretty slick BTW.
