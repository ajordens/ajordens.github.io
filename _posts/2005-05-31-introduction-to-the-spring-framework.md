Rod Johnson has updated his [Introduction to the Spring Framework][1] article on TSS.

I&#8217;ve read the original article and I&#8217;m just making my way through the updated version, it introduces a few of the changes in Spring 1.2. It&#8217;s something I would definitely recommend reading to anyone considering the use of Spring or is just interested in the framework or its underlying technologies and goals.

Also on my reading list tonight was this O&#8217;Reilly Radar [article][2] that talked about the items to consider when one is rolling out an open API. It&#8217;s a good read and you can definitely tell the synergies between the companies that have done well (dodgeball, flickr, oddpost, ebay developers, yahoo developers, etc.) and the ones that have not. In a way, the success of an application/framework comes down to its attractiveness to developers. Like the article points out, if you&#8217;re making developers (in a sense a segment of your customer base) jump through hoops to develop apps using your API, you&#8217;re going to have a difficult time being successful. *That being said, I did try and sign-up for a Yahoo! developer account and their sign-up process was broken. Not everyone is perfect I guess.*

On another note, I failed to get all my chores done tonight. I did go for a run, I did get caught up on my blogs, I did listen to a GNC podcast on the deck, BUT I never did get to updating the resume. That will just have to wait until perhaps tomorrow. I&#8217;m going to go read a bit.

**Update: I just got an email from Toby Elliott at Yahoo! Webservices looking to get to the bottom of the problem. I just attempted to sign up again for a developer id and it worked like a champ. Kudo&#8217;s to Toby and the others at Yahoo! for their responsiveness.**
