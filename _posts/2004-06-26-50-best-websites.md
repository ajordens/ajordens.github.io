Being the weekend, I caught this on [EMERGIC.ORG][1].

TECH TIME: 50 Best Websites: Complete List<  
/a></p> 

Each year TIME Magazine puts together a list of what they consider to the best 50 sites (in their opinion) that launched over the past year.

Lots of stuff that falls outside of my traditional browsing patterns so the list had some value to me. I enjoy discovering new online material and skimmi  
ng link blogs like Erik&#8217;s and Robert Scoble&#8217;s is a pretty simple way to find content. [Erik&#8217;s Linkblog][2] deals  
primarily with technology and [Scoble&#8217;s Linkblog][3] talks about all kinds of cool stuff, basically anything that he  
considers newsworthy at the time.

I guess [Gmail][4]&#8216;s beta launch fell outside TIME&#8217;s story cutoff. Despite what the competitors do (Yahoo and Hotmail), I e  
njoy Gmail&#8217;s simple interface. I don&#8217;t need a gig now, nor will I likely in the near to medium-term future. What I do need is an internet service with st  
rong automatic filtering abilities and spam control. This sort of stuff is not currently provided by my hotmail account, and I can&#8217;t comment on Yahoo sinc  
e I haven&#8217;t actively used it in years. However, the pre-production Gmail is providing me with a great service. All that Google needs now is an IM service  
(perhaps jabber-based ?).
