Evidently, Future Shop (Canadian equivalent of Best Buy) was running a *dorm room challenge* this past week at various locations across the country.

[Pictures][1] from the Vancouver event.

**What is a dorm room challenge?**

They put 6 people in a plexiglass enclosure on the sidewalk outside a store. They filled said enclosure with all kinds of toys (TV&#8217;s, consoles, phones, laptops, etc.). The chosen few had to remain exposed to the world for 5 days.

The contestants [blog&#8217;d][2] about it.

In the end, the winner (I didn&#8217;t follow it so I have no idea how he was chosen) got to keep all the goodies. The others&#8230; they probably got to keep their awesome future shop t-shirt. Congrats to them.
