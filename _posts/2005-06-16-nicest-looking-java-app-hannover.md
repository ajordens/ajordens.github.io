I must say that the next version of the Notes desktop client (code named: &#8220;Hannover&#8221;) is one of the nicest looking java applications I&#8217;ve ever seen.

Screenshots are [available here][1].

What&#8217;s &#8220;Hannover&#8221; you ask?

  * *&#8220;Hannover&#8221; is the next feature release of Notes after 7.0. A ship date isn&#8217;t being announced today. Technical previews of this release are targeted for early 2006. Notes/Domino updates have been shipping on a 12-18 month cycle since 6.0, and the intent is to continue that.*
  * *&#8220;Hannover&#8221; is targeted for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux client platforms.*
  * *&#8220;Hannover&#8221; is Notes, based on the IBM Workplace client technology. We&#8217;ve been discussing this conceptually since Lotusphere 2005. It will do everything that Notes has always done, but leverage the new client architecture. This inevitably leads to questions about how customers will upgrade to that client environment. It&#8217;s too soon to lay that out in detail, but the intention is to make that transition seamless, using tools like the existing SmartUpgrade process.* 
  * *A lot of what you are seeing in &#8220;Hannover&#8221; is evolution of the soon-to-be-shipping Notes plug-in for the Workplace client technology &#8212; already part of Notes 7.0. So even &#8220;today&#8221; (next quarter), you&#8217;ll be able to integrate Notes with other Workplace client apps, including Activity Explorer, Workplace Documents, etc. * 
  * I&#8217;ll add that &#8220;Hannover&#8221; is based on Eclipse. Pretty cool eh?
