Last weekend I attended the very successful first annual Canary Derby in Victoria, BC. The [Canary Derby][1] was put together as a fundraiser for the Canary Foundation BC (an initiative to support the early detection of cancer in the Province). By accounts it was an incredibly successful event, raising just a touch under $50,000 for Cancer research. A big congratulations to all the teams and volunteers involved.

I [blogged][2] a couple months back about the [Canary Foundation][3] itself, basically it&#8217;s an effort put forth by one Don Listwin (ex. Cisco SVP and Canadian to boot) to encourage and support scientific efforts in the area of early detection. To date it&#8217;s primarily been an American initiative but we&#8217;ve (GenoLogics) have done our best to open the lines of communication between the BC Cancer Agency and the Canary Foundation. It&#8217;s proven successful, with Don announcing a donation of $1,000,000 just last month to fund some very important local research labs.
