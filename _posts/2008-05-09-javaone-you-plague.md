I was surprised when the following email came through my inbox last night.

> **URGENT! PUBLIC HEALTH ADVISORY FROM JAVAONE TEAM**
> 
> **<span style="font-weight: normal;">The JavaOne conference team has been notified by the San Francisco Department of Public Health about an identified outbreak of a virus in the San Francisco area. Testing is still underway to identify the specific virus in question, but they believe it to be the Norovirus, a common cause of the &#8220;stomach flu&#8221;, which can cause temporary flu-like symptoms for up to 48 hours. Part of the San Francisco area impacted includes the Moscone Center, the site of the JavaOne conference which is being held this week. We are working with the appropriate San Francisco Department of Public Health and Moscone representatives to mitigate the impact this will have on the conference and steps are being taken overnight to disinfect the facility. We have not received any indication that the show should end early, so will have the full schedule of events on Friday as planned. We hope to see you then.</span>

Fortunately it hasn&#8217;t affected me (<span style="font-style: italic;">knock on wood</span>) but the colleague I came down with is out of commission. Looks like it got Crazy Bob got hit too.
