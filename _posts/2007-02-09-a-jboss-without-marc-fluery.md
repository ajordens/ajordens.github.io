It&#8217;s almost been a year since JavaOne&#8230; you know the one with Marc Fluery up on stage in a red beret and the rest of the crew (notably Bill Burke) sporting the same goofy hat at one point or another.

I bet it&#8217;s been an interesting ride for Marc and it&#8217;s not really a surprise to see him resign. He&#8217;s been both controversial and successful at the same time and has every right to walk away from it. Hell, I&#8217;d probably do it. I can&#8217;t speak from experience but one would imagine RedHat to be an entirely different beast from the geographically dispersed JBoss group. Over the course of last years JavaOne I managed to interact and speak with a number of JBoss employees and developers. The senior JBoss&#8217;ers seemed genuinely happy at the time with the prospect of joining RedHat&#8230; who knows about the actual project committers.  Rumour has it that they may have gotten a bit of a cold shoulder in terms of compensation for their effort.  
From an end-users perspectively, I haven&#8217;t really seen much of a difference from a post-RedHat JBoss. The application server and Hibernate still exist. Not to mention that JBossMQ, unfortunately, still exists. Gavin&#8217;s going full bore on Seam and I really don&#8217;t know what anyone else is doing.  I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be a bit of a shake-up as even bigger ego&#8217;s come into the mix.  
It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what the JBoss presence is like at this years JavaOne.
