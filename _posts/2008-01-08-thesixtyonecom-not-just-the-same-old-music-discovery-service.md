> [thesixtyone][1] is a music discovery game that rewards those who help others listen to good new music. 

If you&#8217;ve ever seen digg.com, this is essentially a music equivalent. Artists upload music, listeners vote, and gradually songs make their way up the chart. Very Web 2.0 (*in a good way*). 

I&#8217;m sure there are others (*pandora.com was pretty good*) but I&#8217;m quite impressed with the quality of music I&#8217;ve listened to so far on thesixtyone. The interface is unintrusive and other than a few initial moments of downtime the site has been rock steady. 

I wonder if they have (or are planning) an API? Would make a pretty nice addition to iGoogle!
