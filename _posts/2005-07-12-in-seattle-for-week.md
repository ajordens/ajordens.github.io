I&#8217;m in Seattle for the week at an [ISB ][1] proteomics training course.

I&#8217;m having a hard enough time just keeping up to date reading my blogroll so I won&#8217;t be posting much this week. What I do write about the course will reside over at [myProteome][2].

Staying at the [Watertown][3] Hotel near Lake Union. It&#8217;s right smack near UW which is pretty cool. I&#8217;ve already been on a few runs through the campus and down along the lake. The hotel itself is pretty modern, not like the Marriott in Cambridge, MA I was staying in a few weeks back. 

That&#8217;s it for now.
