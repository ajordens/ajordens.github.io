It&#8217;s been a couple months now since I announced my latest project, [Appiity][1].

> **Identifying trends on the iTunes App Store and making it easier to find great apps!**

At that time, it was the cumulation of over a years worth of data from the iTunes Marketplace.  When launched, it officially supported US, Canada and UK app stores.

I&#8217;m happy to say that since then, the platform has been expanded to include:

  * **Austrailia**
  * **China**
  * **Germany**
  * **France**
  * **Hong Kong**
  * **Isreal**
  * **Korea**
  * **Japan**
  * **Sweden**

&#8230; with additional countries actively being brought online.

It&#8217;s been interesting to look at charts (*both historical and present*), there is actually a lot of **variability** on charts country-to-country.  Check it out for [yourself][2]!  Only the last 30 days is being exposed via the web interface, but there is a lot more data available.  Contact me if you&#8217;re interested in learning more.

Further to that, I&#8217;m also reaching out to developers with the goal of understanding the pain they&#8217;re experiencing when building apps.  If you have **five minutes**, I would appreciate your feedback on this [survey][3].

Lastly, I&#8217;m proud to announce the first public preview of our [application search][4].  It&#8217;s **live **and links into detailed application pages that show, in detail, an applications performance over the past 30 days.  Want to understand the impact of an Electronic Arts sale?  We have that [data][5].

 

Take some time to explore the site, I&#8217;d love your feedback.

That&#8217;s all for this week!
