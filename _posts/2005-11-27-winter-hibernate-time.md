I was driving home from the gym and noticed the roadside thermometer read 0Â° celsius, signalling a time of year I refer to as *winter hibernate time*. 

It&#8217;s the time of year when it&#8217;s too cold to do a lot of cardio outside, and thus you tend to end up sitting inside watching hockey and drinking someone else&#8217;s beer. The time of year where your lungs freeze if you&#8217;re foolish enough (and I am) to go for a run at 8:00pm. 

For me, I usually try to double up my daily workouts (one at lunch, one after work) while incorporating some form of indoor cardio. I must say I&#8217;m pretty much addicted to sugar and the Christmas season is a particularily bad time for that.

On another workout-related note, the property management guys at work finally followed through on their threat to clean out the gym lockers (I work in a technology park and one of the perks is an on-site gym). Evidently they don&#8217;t want people to actually use the lockers because they&#8217;ve posted notices saying that anything left after a workout will get tossed. There are about 150 lockers with at most 7 people using the gym at any one time. I never did understand the logic so me and a buddy (who has since moved to London but left all his gear in the locker) have been using the same locker for the past 2 years. There have been cleanout threats made previously but the closest we ever came to obeying was removing the lock from our locker.

Last week I walked into the change room and to my surprise there were 5 or 6 large garbage backs strewn on the floor full of everyone&#8217;s clothes, shoes, shower supplies, etc. Nice eh!

**Glenn:** Yes, it&#8217;s true, I couldn&#8217;t save your stuff so you&#8217;re going to have to live without those old insoles and shorts, but I think I may have rescued an old uvic shirt. &#8217;tis life.
