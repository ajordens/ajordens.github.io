Finally broke down and bought a Nintendo Wii today.  I didn&#8217;t think they were still in such high demand but it took a few trips to various stores before I managed to secure a console.  Cost an extra $10 or $20 but Toys R Us had *one *in stock.

Haven&#8217;t bought any games yet but did rent Mario Party 8.  I&#8217;ll talk to the guys at work w/ Wii&#8217;s and see what they have/recommend.  If nothing else, I still have a few GameCube games kicking around.

Only minor problem I have involves the component AV cables I bought.  Turns out they&#8217;re a tad bit short and **barely **(*an understatement) *are able to reach between the component audio inputs and component video inputs.  I&#8217;m not sure what else to do, all of the Wii component cables I saw had the video and audio together.
