Just caught this [blog post][1] about why this person only travel&#8217;s with carry-on luggage. I definitely agree, it&#8217;s also been my preferred way to fly.

I&#8217;ve travelled a lot lately and have never actually missed a connecting flight, but here&#8217;s my take on the flying process. First off, I try to only travel with carry-on luggage. I appreciate the piece of mind it gives me knowing that everything is always within my control. The airlines have enough problems just getting flights going on-time let alone making sure your baggage gets to your destination at the same time you do. Even if the baggage does get there, it&#8217;s almost gauranteed to get snagged or damaged in some way or another. Between my laptop backpack and my big suitcase, I can fit enough gear to last 12 or so days. Most if not all major airlines will allow you to take 2 carry-on bags so it works perfectly. My secret is to secure an aisle seat which allows me easy access to the overhead storage bins. I also try to be one of the first people on the plane to ensure that I get all my baggage stored securely. There&#8217;s nothing worse than being last on the airplane, discovering theres no room for your baggage and being forced to check them or straddle them. Plus, the aisle seat allows you easily grab stuff out of your stored bags rather than having to stuff everything under the seat in front of you and use up valuable foot space. 

So there you have it, if you don&#8217;t mind carrying your bags, carry-on is the way to go.
