At work we&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of replacing Bugzilla with something a little more flexible, nicer looking, and easier to use.

I&#8217;ve been meaning to look into JIRA for some time, having come across it many times in the oss world. 

So today I decided to spend 15 minutes and sign-up and download the Professional version of JIRA. Nice sign-up process, didn&#8217;t even ask for my company ph  
\# and address. Hopefully that means that i won&#8217;t get annoying sales people calling 30 days from now.

Decided to download the entire package and deploy it with its pre-packed tomcat instance and hsql. All went well.

Within 10 minutes of downloading I had a working installation of JIRA. The next step was to see how difficult it would be to migrate our existing bugzilla  
content. Quick google search, piece of cake, JIRA provides built-in support for that. I was expecting some offline tool that I would run to do the dat  
a conversion, nice touch to see it built into the application.

So now, I&#8217;ve got it all installed, I think I&#8217;ve given it my blessing as a cool system to work with and I have passed it off to the bug keepers for their i  
nput. The idea is to hopefully be able to extend the software enough to easily support bug tracking, feature requests, etc for fairly large and diverse pr  
ojects. 

I assume I&#8217;ll get buy in on the system, and there are probably other features that I would like to check out myself. I notice some CVS integration, so I&#8217;l  
l have to do a bit of reading on that.

Anyways, just thought I would share my comments on JIRA after spending a bit of time installing and experimenting with it. Dead simple registration and i  
nstallation process.
