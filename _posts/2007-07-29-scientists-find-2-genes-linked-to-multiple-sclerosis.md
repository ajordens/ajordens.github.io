Interesting [article][1] over on CBC describing the recent finding of two genes that from early indications appear to increase the risk of developing MS by 20-30%. Something that scientists have been looking to find for 30 years.

The company I work for provides scientific data management solutions for researchers doing work in genomics and proteomics so these types of studies are of particular interest to me. In fact, I was just reading the other day about another interesting genetic study (*from a year or two back*) on a group of centarians that uncovered some potential markers of longevity at the gene level ([podcast][2]). 

As technology improves and scientific throughput increases, we *should* be seeing breakthroughs like these become much more common. Time will tell.
