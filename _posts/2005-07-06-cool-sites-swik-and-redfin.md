The folks at [SourceLabs][1] have released [Swik][2], the free and open database of Open Source projects that anyone can edit. It&#8217;s sort of a SourceForge/Freshmeat meets Delicious meets [enter your search engine here]. It has a wiki aspect for allow users to modify content which is an interesting perspective. I guess the mass awareness of &#8220;open-source&#8221; dictates a need for sites like Swik, CodeZoo, Freshmeat, etc. 

The second, and arguably far cooler, site is [Redfin][3]. Redfin is Seattle, Bellevue and The Greater Eastside&#8217;s only aerial residential real estate search engine. It presents a pretty slick interface (ala Google Maps) and overlays MLS real estate information. Pretty slick and the concept is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about as of late. 

Example search, [All houses in Medina > $1 million][4].
