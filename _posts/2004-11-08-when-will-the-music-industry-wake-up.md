[When will the music industry do it right?][1]

Mark Cuban makes some very good points on the current state of the music industry and what he thinks could be done to increase revenues, legitimicize p2p d  
ownloads and remain sustainable.

I think that many of his points are valid and we&#8217;ll see if there is any headway made in the next year or so. The music industry is in a downward spiral an  
d needs to come up with something novel to pull itself out. 

and now the latest news is that the movie industry feels that they are suffering at the hands of P2P users. If they concentrated on quality not quantity I  
&#8216;m sure the major production houses would make out alright&#8230;.

are the gas/oil companies going to complain in 5-10 years because we&#8217;re all going to be driving electric hybrids?
