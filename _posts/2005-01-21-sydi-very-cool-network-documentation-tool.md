[SYDI &#8211; Simplifying Network Documentation][1]

SYDI is a very cool set of scripts that allow a network administrator to easily put together a series of documents about the various (windows) PC&#8217;s on his  
network. I haven&#8217;t yet used it in the office, because (1)I&#8217;m a developer and don&#8217;t have time to deal with more than the bare minimum of system administrat  
or tasks and (2)I run linux. 

Anyways, I just ran it on the couple of windows PC&#8217;s on my home network and it generated nice Word reports. It&#8217;s worth checking out if you have this sort  
of requirement. I know we had to go through a network documentation phase as part of our investors due dilligence process and this type of script would h  
ave made it substantially smoother.

SYDI is a collection of Vbscripts to help people get started with the documentation process. What it can do is to collect information from a Windows Server  
(SYDI-Server) or a MS SQL Server (SYDI-SQL) and present its findings in a MS Word document. This way the process isnt so boring since a lot of information  
is gathered for you, another way it helps you is that you are given a general document which gives you an idea of what could be included in your server do  
cumentation. If you feel like you dont need everything the scripts collect there are parameters which decide what goes into the word document. So if you li  
ke the output but dont need a particular section, like printers or services you can easily remove them. SYDI has been tested with Windows 2000 and higher,  
Word 2000 and higher, SQL 7.0 and higher.
