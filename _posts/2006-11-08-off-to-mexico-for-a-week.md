I&#8217;ve decided to take next week off and book a last minute trip to [Puerto Vallarta][1].

Looking forward to it&#8230; Last year I made it down to the Mayan Riveria for a couple weeks and given that we&#8217;ve entered the rainy season here on the west coast, it&#8217;ll be nice to see some sun again.

I&#8217;m not even going to take my laptop this time but I couldn&#8217;t resist buying another 1gig memory card for the digital camera.

**Plus **I had my dad do some surgery on my Creative Zen Micro MP3 player and all is well again, I&#8217;ll have some tunes for the plane ride down. I still don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever buy another Creative media product again.
