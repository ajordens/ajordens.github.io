What do you do when (heaven forbid) you have an over abundance of wildlife in a state?

Why, you lower the legal hunting age!

I guess all the 12 year olds in Wisconsin had younger brothers with itch trigger fingers that just couldn&#8217;t wait to get out into the woods. Well they now can, the age restriction has been lowered to 8 years old.

I think that when I was 8, I was probably playing Comander Keen and the closest I came to a gun was Castle Wolfenstein or perhaps Doom I. The critics fear that an 8 year old&#8217;s motor skills aren&#8217;t developed enough to handle a gun. My question is, have you seen an eight year old do anything coordinated? and just what type of gun are you going to give to someone like that?  
Why **play **deer hunter when you can go out back and shoot yourself a 5 point for real!
