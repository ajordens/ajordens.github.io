**Will the controversy ever end&#8230;.**

[TMC Terminates Business with JBoss,  
Inc.][1]

From <http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=26234>,  
*  
We attempted to diplomatically work through our differences that arose from recent events. However, the instability and unprofessional conduct from JBoss I  
nc. CEO Marc Fleury eroded our optimism for reaching resolution. We regret the inconvenience this may cause JBoss, Inc.</p> 

As a company that stewards communities and performs research, we must balance the needs of vendors and individuals who make up the ecosystem we serve. We w  
ill continue news coverage and editorial in a neutral manner on technology, events and vendors. We will aggressively address any attempts to lower the valu  
e of our communities.

The Middleware Company believes in the promise of open source middleware and wishes great success to all such initiatives, including JBoss. We apologize to  
any individual or organization that may have been impacted by recent events.

A comment further down in the thread (from JBoss&#8217; director of marketing says that it was JBoss that originally terminated the agreement.

Can&#8217;t we all just get along. I consider JBoss to be a decent application server and given the price, one of the best.
