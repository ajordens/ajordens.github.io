Finally got around to migrating from 1.5 to 2.0.

No major hurdles, and the upgrade process was fairly seemless.

I&#8217;m toying around with a different theme for the time being but may go back to the Kubrick-derivative I was using back in 1.5.x.Â  Came across a nifty DHTML flickr badge that you see situated in the top-right corner of the page.

The improved post editor in 2.0 also looks good but I haven&#8217;t played around with it enough to discover it&#8217;s finer details.
