My copy of Ted&#8217;s Effective Enterprise Java arrived today and I&#8217;ve spent a few minutes browsing some of the tips. 

I&#8217;m looking forward to both using it as a day-to-day reference and eventually reading it cover to cover. From what I&#8217;ve read it appears well written with  
enough examples sprinkled in to keep things interesting. I would like to post my thoughts on an ongoing basis as I work my way through it. 

I&#8217;ve also got J2EE without the EJB on to go, and Code Complete 2e waiting to be finished. 

Looks like I&#8217;ve got some reading to do this winter. Long live Amazon.
