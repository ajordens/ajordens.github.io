We&#8217;re going through a group exercise at work to provide definitions of our companies core values.

**Excellence **&#8211; *An overriding commitment to continous improvement and never settling for &#8216;good enough&#8217;.*

Pretty succint and captures the essence of what the term means to me.Â  It actually came to me in the middle of a workout at the gym, amazing when and where ideas present themselves.
