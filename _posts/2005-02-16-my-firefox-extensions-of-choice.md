I recently installed a few more firefox plugins on my ubuntu laptop (running Firefox 1.0)

Current list:

Add Bookmark Here  
Gmail Notifier  
Google Pagerank Status  
Bookmarks Synchronizer  
Gcache  
ColorZilla  
ForecastFox  
FoxyTunes  
Foxylicious

I have the first 5 running for a long time and the add bookmark here and bookmarks synchronizer are two plugins I couldn&#8217;t live without.

ColorZilla looks to be pretty cool and allows the usually to easily use a color picker to chose colors from a web page. ForecastFox just embeds weather fo  
recasts in the status bar of firefox. I usually have something similar running in my system tray but the firefox one looks to have additional functionalit  
y. I haven&#8217;t really played with FoxyTunes, hopefully it plays nice with xmms. Foxylicious allows me to integrate my del.icio.us bookmarks into Firefox.  
I&#8217;ve been using the service for awhile (mind you I&#8217;ve been slack with my tagging) and its definately nice to include this stuff in Firefox. This later ext  
ension may actually replace my bookmarks synchronizer as I use del.icio.us for most of my bookmarking nowadays.
