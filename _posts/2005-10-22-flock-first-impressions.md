Looks like a browser, acts like a browser, must be a browser&#8230;.right?



So I downloaded [Flock][1]&#8216;s developer preview this morning. I&#8217;m actually posting this from Flock&#8217;s internal blog editor so if it works as expected that&#8217;s +1 for them.&nbsp; The editor has a few UI oddities but given the 0.5pre designation, those are to be expected. 

It looks like an interesting idea and I look forward to future enhancements with the del.icio.us integration.&nbsp; Many of my del.icio.us tags are dot separated and I&#8217;d like the browser to build a favourite&#8217;s list with drop-downs derived from the tag hierarchy.&nbsp; There&#8217;s a firefox plugin already that does this so I don&#8217;t think this would be overly difficult to implement.&nbsp; It would also be nice to have the ability to put tags into categories and have them realized as drop-downs within the toolbar.&nbsp; 

Overall I like the emphasis on tagged content and I look forward to future releases.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have more comments as I continue to experiment with it, but my first impressions are positive.&nbsp; 



**Edit: **I&#8217;m not sure I like the way the built-in editor html-ized my post, makes it a tad difficult to modify the post from within wordpress. Another interesting feature: Flock recognized when I was logging into wordpress and asked if I wanted to save the password. 

**Update: ** Bart (from Flock) has given a [good description][2] of just what Flock is, what it hopes to accomplish, and why it is what it is.
