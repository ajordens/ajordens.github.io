I&#8217;ve wanted to go to JavaOne for a number of years now but the opportunity has never presented itself.

It looks like that&#8217;s going to change this year as somehow I&#8217;ve convinced my employer that it&#8217;d be in both of our best interests to send me.

I&#8217;ve transitioning into more of a technical lead role (I work for a startup so we all wear plenty of hats) so I&#8217;m looking forward to the conference and think it&#8217;ll be a pretty good experience.  I went to NFJS last year when it was in Seattle and had a pretty good time.  I think it&#8217;s a great conference as well and I&#8217;ll most likely be attending it again this year.

Having never been to a JavaOne before, is there anything to look out for?  It looks like they&#8217;ve put a new system in place to pre-register for session&#8217;s.  That takes some of the fun out of last minute decisions, but I suppose its a step in the right direction of ensuring that everyone gets a spot in the sessions of their choice.

I haven&#8217;t had a good look through the session catalog yet, but I definitely plan on attending anything given by Romain Guy, JGoodies Karsten and the JBoss/Hibernate/Spring guys.

I&#8217;ve also never been to San Francisco so I&#8217;ll probably take a couple days before the conference to do a bit of exploring.
