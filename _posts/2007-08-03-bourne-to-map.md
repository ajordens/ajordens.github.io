Just got back from watching *[Bourne Ultimatum][1]*.

Best of the series as far as I&#8217;m concerned, definitely worth checking out.

Couldn&#8217;t help but notice the use of *Google Maps* for all their GPS tracking and in-car navigation systems <img src="http://littlesquare.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Didn&#8217;t look all that outlandish either.
