I’ve been knee deep in the Java world for a long time doing a combination of desktop, backend J2EE (spring/hibernate) and most recently Seam-based web application development.

It’s the Christmas break and I’ve taken a bit of time to create an Ubuntu VM with Rails 2.2 installed in it.&#160; Rails has come a long ways since I last was working (*playing is probably a more appropriate descriptor*) with it.&#160; I’ve got a couple ideas to perhaps flush out, but before that, I need to re-learn a few things and come back up to speed.

Installation was simple and straight forward enough, there are a number of decent guides for getting Ruby and Rails [installed][1] in Ubuntu.&#160; Since I’m working in Ubuntu and not on my work MacBook Pro, there will be no TextMate for me.&#160; Fortunately, the guys from JetBrains have released early access versions of their new Ruby IDE [RubyMine][2].&#160; I’m a long time user of their Java IDE and if the Ruby equivalent is anywhere near as good, it’ll be a real winner.

RubyMine is nice in that it seems to largely delegate to the command-line Rails generators.&#160; No magic and if you spot an error (*it’s still beta software*), you can still execute the respective command-line tools and continue working.

&#160;

Don’t have much else to say, I hope everyone is enjoying their respective holiday seasons.&#160; 

Happy New Year!
