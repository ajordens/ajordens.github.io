Sitting in Logan Airport getting caught up on my blogs and came across something called [CodeZoo][1] from O&#8217;Reilly.

*  
CodeZoo exists to help you find high-quality, freely available, reusable components, getting you past the repetitive parts of coding, and onto the rest and  
the best of your projects. Its a fast-forward button for your compiler.

Looks interesting right now and we&#8217;ll see what the uptake is on it over the next few months.
