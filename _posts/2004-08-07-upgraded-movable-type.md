Finally got around to upgrading my installation of movable type from 2.61 to 3.01. 

Everything went nice and smooth. A trivial upgrade process.

Given that I had to re-setup the default templates, I decided it was time to start creating my own css style. Currently it&#8217;s a work in progress, but it sh  
ouldn&#8217;t take much more work to get something suitable.
