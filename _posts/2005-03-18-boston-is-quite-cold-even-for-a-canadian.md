Now I&#8217;m from Canada so everyone in the city thinks I should be used to cold weather. I am to a certain degree, but the dry cold 2degree weather I&#8217;ve been  
experiencing in Boston is something i don&#8217;t particularily like.

I&#8217;m in the city for business, having a few meetings with a large biotech. I&#8217;ll be back in a week and half for a continuation, hopefully bringing the nice  
west coast weather with me.

Boston and Cambridge are interesting cities(?). The metro train system rocks and I can get anywhere that I need to relatively quickly. The hotel I&#8217;m stay  
ing at is basically right across the street from the MIT campus so I&#8217;ve done a couple trips through it, stealthily taking pictures inside of random buildin  
gs. The strata building is definately interesting to look at.

I&#8217;ve also scoped out Fenway Park (but didn&#8217;t get a tour this time) and checked out Harvard. St. Patrick&#8217;s day packed the city and bars were charging a red  
iculous (to me) $30/$40 US cover charge to get in. Even though I was freezing I wandered around until I found a place with a slight lineup but no cover.

All in all, Boston&#8217;s cold. I&#8217;m overlooking the charles river and it&#8217;s partially frozen.
