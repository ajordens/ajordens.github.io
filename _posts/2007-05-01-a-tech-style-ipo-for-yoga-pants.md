Just reading CBC.ca and noticed this [gem][1].

Looks like athletic company *[Lululemon Athletica][2]* is planning a $200 million IPO. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Merrill Lynch & Co. are involved. Couldn&#8217;t help but remind me of the various dot com IPO&#8217;s of the late nineties. Difference here, *Lululemon* is a powerful brand with real revenues that has cornered the market in womens athletic wear. Plus, I doubt the valuation is nearly as high.

Not sure what or who *Lululemon* is?

Walk into any gym and there&#8217;s a good chance that those spandexy-type pants and shirts (*w/ the little upside-down U logo*) all the women are wearing are *Lululemon*. If you&#8217;ve got a daughter, she&#8217;ll fill you in more. It started out as Yoga wear but I&#8217;d bet that most people wearing the brand nowadays have never stepped into a studio.

It&#8217;s an interesting phenomenon that&#8217;s spread like wildfire over the past 5 years. They do have a men&#8217;s line but it&#8217;s not high on my list of thngs to get. Give me a [Nike sweatshirt][3] and I&#8217;m good. My girl friend&#8217;s closet is a different story.

Either way, good on them for being a local company (they started in Vancouver, BC) shooting high and hitting the big time.

I laughed at this comment from one of the various press releases about the offering:

*The move is not altogether surprising. In 2005, Chip Wilson, Lululemon&#8217;s founder and head designer, sold 48 per cent of the Vancouver-based company to two U.S. private equity firms, Advent International Corp. and Highland Capital, for $108 million. Lululemon&#8217;s proprietary &#8216;Luon&#8217; fabric holds up under exercise stress and <u>&#8216;women are convinced that it makes their butts look better</u>,&#8217; said an analyst commenting on the yogawear retailer&#8217;s success.*
