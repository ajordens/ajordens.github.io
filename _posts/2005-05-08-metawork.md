I&#8217;ve added a Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metawork" target=_blank>entry</a> about Metawork.

I agree with <a nofollows target=_blank href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/1590.aspx">Rory Blyth</a> that Metawork should be defined as &#8220;the work that y  
ou have to do in order to get your real work done.&#8221;

I&#8217;ve been bombarded with metawork the past two months, you know its bad when your boss has also coined the term &#8216;metawork&#8217;. My metawork has ranged from H  
R to IT to Purchasing to Travelling, etc. Its not that I don&#8217;t like variety in the work place, don&#8217;t get me wrong, its a major part of the reason I&#8217;m stil  
l around. I just think its funny that I&#8217;m not the only one talking about &#8216;metawork&#8217;. 

example) I&#8217;ve spent 3 or 4 weeks of the past 2 months on the east coast at various tradeshows and customer sites. Heading back to Philly and Boston next  
week for 11 or 12 days. 

All this and I&#8217;m really just a programmer/team lead/technology lead. The life of a startup employee is enviable <img src="http://littlesquare.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Luckily I had a two week (non-work related) stay in Mexico which helped get me grounded and motivated again. 

Of course, metawork wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if one didn&#8217;t have deadlines on features you&#8217;re supposed to be overseeing and weren&#8217;t forced into working weekends a  
nd nights just to stay on top of things.
