Although its still in an incubation stage, Microsoft recently released part 3 of their start.com initiative. You can check out the latest incarnation [here][1] or [here][2] (if you want to skip the little puzzle).

Start.com is still in a preview phase but offers an interesting insight into what Microsoft might be planning for their next generation portal. Everyone in this game is trying to one up each other, I wouldn&#8217;t call Google the pioneer of AJAX but they definitely did bring it to the mainstream. With competition comes innovation so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Microsoft and Yahoo bring to the table. Anyone have a Yahoo 360 invite to send my way?

On the blogging front its nice to see the portal incorporating feeds and supporting opml. However I haven&#8217;t experiemented enough to see if it holds promise to replace my current web-based feed reader, bloglines. I&#8217;m a fairly demanding user in this respect and would rather use a multitude of tools to get the job done than one do-it-all cludgy tool. Once firefox support is rolled out (it is coming right?), I&#8217;ll play with it more.

The start.com UI is pleasant to look at and might prove usable once tuned for customer usage patterns. Will it replace Google News? I don&#8217;t think so, but it could offer competition when/if it goes live in some incarnation. My immediate suggestion beyond Firefox support, is the integration and sharing of different types of content&#8230; rss support is a good start though. For the record I stopped using Google News when they withdrew support for RSS feeds.

You have to remember that it&#8217;s all just an incubation project and might never see the light of day. That being said, I showed it to a couple people today who were impressed with the overall L&#038;F aspects of the site. 

The start.com program manager&#8217;s blog is available [here][3].
