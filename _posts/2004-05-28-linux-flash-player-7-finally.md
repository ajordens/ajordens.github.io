Linux users can finally download a Flash 7 Player from Macromedia (available [<u>here</u>][1]). 

Hopefully this will clear up some of the flash-related problems I&#8217;ve been having with  
Mozilla Firefox and various news sites that present flash (abcnews, espn&#8230;etc). Although, for others having similar problems with flash sites, I&#8217;d recomm  
end the [<u>FlashBlock</u>][2] Mozilla/Mozilla Firefox extension. 

From it&#8217;s website, *Flashblock is an extension for the Mozilla and Firebird browsers that takes a pessemistic approach to dealing with Macromedia Flash c  
ontent on a webpage and blocks ALL Flash content from loading. It then leaves a placeholder on the page that allows you to click to view the Flash content.  
* 

I must say that it works very well and improves the overall browsing experience (imho).
