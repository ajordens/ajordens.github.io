sland Java Users Group</a> meeting last night.

A synopsis can be found <a href="http://www.mosabuam.com/modules.php?op=modload&#038;name=News&#038;file=article&#038;sid=125" target=_new>here</a>.

All in all, a pretty interesting event involving people from all walks of life with different goals and experiences. I think its only the beginning and sh  
ould build into a valuable resource for the community.

I&#8217;m glad we finally something going in Victoria, it&#8217;s long overdue and I&#8217;m more than willing to help out. No zealot fighting so far, so thats a good sign
