As the title says, work has replaced my previous Dell Lattitude D620 with a new 15.4" MacBook Pro.

I&#8217;ve only had the MBP for a couple days now so I&#8217;m still getting used to OS X.  There&#8217;s a lot more to learn but my two day impressions are positive.  Even the girlfriend likes it (she&#8217;s wanted a Mac for awhile now).

I&#8217;ve been using Linux for the past 12 or 13 years so I appreciate the ease with which I can open Terminal.app and run the basic gnu tools.  All I need now is a nice multi-tab&#8217;d terminal application (a quick Google search brought up [iTerm][1], which looks promising).

The past couple of years have been spent developing Java applications in Windows.  I used Cygwin extensively and honestly it was pretty good.  The JavaVM&#8217;s (Sun&#8217;s primarily although I usually used JRockit) seemed a bit more optimized for Windows and the application server started/restarted significantly faster.  Not the ideal benchmark but an important one given how much time we all spend doing deployments.  I should note that JRockit on Linux did perform faster in this regard than Sun did.

I&#8217;ve switched from using [BlogDesk][2] to [Qumana][3] for blog composition. It was interesting to see that Qumana is actually developed in Vancouver, BC.  

World of Warcraft installed without a hitch.

[Quicksilver][4] (and Spotlight to a lesser degree) provide a suitable replacement for the functionality that I was using Google Desktop for.  Namely, the ability to easily launch applications.

I don&#8217;t compose a lot of documents so I don&#8217;t think Microsoft Office will be a significant loss.  I&#8217;ve got NeoOffice installed but may decide to use Google Docs instead.

I&#8217;ve been on vacation for the past couple weeks so I haven&#8217;t had an opportunity to do any actual development on the new machine.  That being said, I was able to get my development environment setup without too much of a problem.  Fortunately some kind soul has made [PostgreSQL binaries][5] available.  IntelliJ IDEA seems to work equally well in OS X as it did in Windows.  The only downside from a Java perspective is Apple dragging it&#8217;s feet around support for Java6.  We haven&#8217;t migrated to it yet but Mac support is the gating factor.

That&#8217;s all I have to say for now.  It seems like a good platform for daily development and overall general usage.
