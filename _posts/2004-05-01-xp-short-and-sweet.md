A nice short little freshmeat editorial on XP. I especially like the quote *In Russia there is a famous saying: &#8220;never show halfdone work to an idiot&#8221;</  
i>, with which I agree completely. I&#8217;m currently working in an environment which has split personalities when it comes to development processes. We&#8217;re gr  
owing  
fairly rapidly so we&#8217;ve been putting effort in lately to try and formalize our processes and make it easier to have everyone on the same page.</p> 

Slight tangent&#8230;

I&#8217;m a firm believer in having the customer involved throughout the process but when developing commercial software, I believe that your sole concern should  
be ensuring that your customer receives high-quality purpose-built software. Without involving the customer, how can you assure yourself that what you ar  
e constructing will be useful and generate the necessary revenues? However, if you are going to involve the customer, you have to be prepared to manage ex  
pectations on both sides. *Under promise and over deliver* as the old addage says, don&#8217;t promise the house and give them a shed. 

Promise a shed and deliver a house&#8230;just make sure that the walls don&#8217;t fall down. I&#8217;m ok with a release date slipping (slightly) as long as it&#8217;s directl  
y related to ensuring the quality of software being shipped. Of course I&#8217;m still a developer and, as such, somewhat shielded from business operation conce  
rns.
