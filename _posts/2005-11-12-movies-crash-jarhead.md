I saw Crash for the second time this weekend (second for me, first for Sarah). I won&#8217;t get into the details but I really enjoyed it the first time, and this time I picked up a few minor details that went un-noticed in the theatre. It&#8217;s a movie seemingly full of off-the-wall loose ends that all end up fitting together.

It&#8217;s a provoking movie and I&#8217;d recommend it to all, you won&#8217;t be disappointed. As an aside, it&#8217;s nice to see a number of big names come together with the result not being some over-hyped summer blockbuster.

[IMDB][1] likes it too, 8.5/10 and #57 on it&#8217;s top 250 list.

Tonight we went and saw Jarhead, Jamie Foxx&#8217;s latest film. It&#8217;s a movie about war (era: desert shield/storm) in which the main character(s) were thrawted in each attempt to kill. All in all, a somewhat interesting movie about a group of marines, their training regiment and the determination to kill that goes along with battle. Sadly, not much more than that.

Crash 1, Jarhead 0.
