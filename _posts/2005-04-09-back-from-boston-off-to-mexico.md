I haven&#8217;t been able to post very often lately.

I&#8217;ve been visiting a client in Boston for 3 of the past 4 weeks and just got back two days ago.

I&#8217;m packing up today to head to Vancouver, hop on a plane tomorrow morning, and get off in Cancun. Going to spend a couple weeks at a resort an hour or so  
south of Cancun.

Should be quite nice and I&#8217;m looking forward to the break. I&#8217;ll have my laptop so we&#8217;ll see how bad work needs to get a hold of me.

I&#8217;ve brought my copy of better, lighter, faster Java to re-read, hibernate in action and J2EE Dev without EJB. We&#8217;ll see just how much time I dedicate to  
reading and/or listening to podcasts on the zen micro.

Cheers!
