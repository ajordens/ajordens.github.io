I&#8217;ve been using Logitech&#8217;s latest [Cordless Desktop][1] offering for a couple weeks now at work and have been ***very*** happy.

The keyboard is awesome, it&#8217;s the first keyboard that I&#8217;ve ever actually made use of the media keys (primarily for controlling iTunes).  Nice layout and quite comfortable for coding, a little clicky perhaps but I personally don&#8217;t mind that and with headphones it&#8217;s unnoticeable.  If you&#8217;re like me and used Microsoft keyboards in the past and still haven&#8217;t quite gotten used to the Fn key on the Mac, I highly recommend this keyboard.

As for the mouse, I actually still prefer a [Mighty Mouse][2] for general comfort and aesthetics but the Logitech isn&#8217;t too bad either (it&#8217;s very similar to traditional PC mice). 

Lastly, I&#8217;d like to throw a shout out regarding [iStat menus][3].  It provides the same basic system information but instead of being displayed on your desktop or dashboard, it&#8217;s viewable in your menu bar.</p>
