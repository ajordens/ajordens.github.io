[Why I put my phone number on my blog][1]

Robert Scoble, of Microsoft, just posted an interesting story that came about as a result of him posting his cell phone number on his blog.

Turns out that a producer of ABC&#8217;s Extreme Home Makeover (a pretty cool show I must say) was wondering if Microsoft would be interested in donating a coupl  
e or two to help out a family in need. The producer did a search for Microsoft, came across Robert&#8217;s blog and decided to give him a call.

Can a company possible buy better promotion. Extreme Home Makeover is probably one of the best shows on TV for product placement and what, Microsoft has t  
o donate a few laptops (or better yet Robert, some Tablet PC&#8217;s). There must be some in-house graphic designers that the three girls could come up and visi  
t.

Apple could also get involved with this. They definately have designers and Cupertino is probably nice this time of year (??). Invite the trio up, give t  
hem a tour and them then design their own ipod. Is that too big of a request?

A true feel good story that all came about from a simple cell phone number posted on a blog.

Give Robert a medal.
