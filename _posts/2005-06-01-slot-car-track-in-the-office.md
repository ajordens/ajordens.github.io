We have had a slot car track setup in our office for the better part of the past week. We&#8217;re attending the American Society for Mass Spectrometry [conference][1] next week and will have a hospitality suite setup to entertain clients and potential clients alike. The slot car track is going to be setup in the suite so in the interest of adequate testing (hey, we&#8217;re developers), we *just *had to get it setup and running in the office before hand. It&#8217;s actually a fairly substantial setup with one of our developers even writing a custom interface to track winning times, etc. We had a bit of fun with it at the end of today, discovering that the cars break apart and snap back together fairly easily (probably a good thing given the expected audience).
