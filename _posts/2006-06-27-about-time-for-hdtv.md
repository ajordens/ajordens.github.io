I bought an HDTV-capable plasma TV last Christmas and have been fighting the urge to go full HD until today.

The thought of watching the World Cup in all it&#8217;s glory proved too much so I called up Shaw Cable today and scheduled an install for this Thursday.  The HDTV box itself costs $510 CDN w/ taxes but actually includes a $10/month reduction for the next 10 months&#8230; better than a kick in the pants.  Plus I&#8217;ll get to sample all the HD movie channels for the next month at no cost.

Now let&#8217;s see how long Argentina and Brazil last.
