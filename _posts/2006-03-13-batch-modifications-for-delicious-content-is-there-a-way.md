Anyone know if its possible?

I&#8217;ve got a significant number of bookmarks but I&#8217;d like to do a bit of re-organization. Trouble is, I haven&#8217;t come across a mechanism to do it in any way that resembles a batch. It would be rather tedious to have to resort to entry-by-entry edits.

What I have come across are a couple of greasemonkey scripts that might be a step in the right direction. They might work, but why isn&#8217;t similar functionality already provided by the service itself?
