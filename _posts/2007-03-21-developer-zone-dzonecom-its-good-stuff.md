Previously my developer-centric (aggregated) feed of choice came from [javablogs.com][1].&nbsp; However it&rsquo;s signal to noise ratio has been on a downward spiral as of late.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s increasingly difficult to find any useful nuggets amongst all the foreign (and graphic/non ascii character posts) and the off-topic &lsquo;this is what my life is like&rsquo; posts.&nbsp; I want concise, to the point tech discussions and *java.blogs *isn&rsquo;t cutting it (I&rsquo;ve been reading it less frequently the past couple months, perhaps it&rsquo;s gotten better?).

Enter the [DZone][2].&nbsp;

  I&rsquo;ve been a subscriber for since it&rsquo;s inception and although it got off to a bit of a rocky start, I&rsquo;m quite impressed with the quality of the feed now.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t specifically target Java and perhaps it is a bit too focused on &lsquo;framework X vs. framework Y&rsquo;, but it does generally deliver interesting aggregated content.

  According to my Google Reader trends, java.blogs still has far higher daily traffic.&nbsp; ~156 items/day vs. ~29 items/day.&nbsp; In fact, that&rsquo;s even higher than the digg feed (~103 items/day).&nbsp;

**UPDATE:&nbsp; **As pointed out by Rick in the comments, DZone is a community, not unlike digg, where users submit links and are able to vote on submissions.&nbsp; Higher votes translates to a front page spot.&nbsp; Java blogs is a basic aggregator where it will implicitly pickup all posts from any feed you provide.&nbsp; Thanks Rick and Tim for commenting.
