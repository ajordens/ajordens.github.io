I was just about to go to bed when I got an email from the folks at [Scrybe][1] inviting me into their beta (I suspect I applied awhile back and they&#8217;re just clearing through a backlog now).

The launch details are [here][2]. Their blog is also [here][3].  
I just logged in and played around with it for a few minutes. I don&#8217;t know very much about the product but it appears to be (another) online calendar and task tool (at least that&#8217;s what the initial phase looks like). The UI is flash-based and surprising easy to navigate. A double click here and a single click here and all of a sudden your jumping from the year perspective to the hourly perspective ðŸ˜‰

I&#8217;m evaluating it right now on a Windows XP box with Firefox 2.0 and it&#8217;s running fine. It also sports an offline mode which although I haven&#8217;t tried yet could potentially set it apart from some of the competition. It also has a nifty ability to print calendars/tasks in such a way that you can fold them up neatly and take them with you (hopefully this isn&#8217;t their idea of an offline mode ðŸ˜‰

I&#8217;m going to go to bed now so I&#8217;ll close with a general concern about these types of offerings. For all intents and purposes I&#8217;ve effectively sold my soul to Google. They own my email and desktop search. If I do track tasks and dates online I currently use Google&#8217;s tools. Moving forward, I&#8217;d seriously consider using Writely/Google&#8217;s word processor once they get some semblance of an offline version.

This isn&#8217;t to discount what Scrybe is doing and I haven&#8217;t read into them enough to say whether or not they&#8217;re competing directly with Google. I think there&#8217;s plenty of room for improvement (on the part of Google) with respect to user interface (amongst other things) but ultimately it comes down to data management. Google&#8217;s #1 far and beyond.

That being said, I&#8217;ll give Scrybe a shot over the next while to see how it performs. From the talk on their forums it looks like multi-person synchronization is in the cards which would be kind of interesting. If they could get it to sync (even just a push) with Google I&#8217;d be happy.

Time for bed. Snow storm in the morning.
