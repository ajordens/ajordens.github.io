> Nearly 14 years after the once mighty browser made its first desktop appearance as Mosaic Netscape 0.9, its disappearance comes as little surprise. Although Netscape accounted for more than 80 per cent of the browser market in 1995, the arrival of Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer in the same year brought stiff competition and surpassed Netscape within three years.

Looks like [9.0.0.6][1] will be the last release. I must say that&#8217;s a long way from the <span style="font-style: italic;">.9/1.0</span> releases I spent my teenage years supporting at the local ISP.
