[Gallina][1]

A cool (proof of concept) blog tool that uses a GMail account as its backend storage mechanism&#8230;

Features  
* Uses GMail messages as &#8220;entries&#8221; (the message star is the publish status)  
* Replies to conversations are the &#8220;entry comments&#8221;  
* Uses libgmailer (gmail-lite project) to connect to GMail  
* Uses XML/XSLT  
* Is free software ðŸ˜‰ (GPL)

Pretty slick, could be interesting given the fact that most people seem to have an excess of google invites. The site is currently slashdoted so please b  
e patient&#8230;.

Google provides the infrastructure and end-user&#8217;s provide the applications. I wonder if this sort of thing was in line with google&#8217;s initial intention for  
their mail service.
