[NewsIsFree: News Maps &#8211; in collaboration  
with The Hive Group][1]

A java applet that presents a clean, clear and efficient way to visualize a large number of articles. Provides decent filtering abilities. If the web alre  
ady provides your news fix, [NewsIsFree News Maps][2] might be for you. 

I think it would be cool if it were possible to use such an interface to generate aggregated RSS feeds.
