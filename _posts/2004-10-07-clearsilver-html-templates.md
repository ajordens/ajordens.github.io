[Neotonic ClearSilver][1]

Playing with Bloglines led me to ClearSilver. *Clearsilver is a fast, powerful, and language-neutral HTML template system. In both static content sites  
and dynamic HTML applications, it provides a separation between presentation code and application logic which makes working with your project easier.*

I haven&#8217;t played with Clearsilver yet but there does appear to be some significant use by Yahoo (Groups), Google (Groups 2), and Plaxo.

Interesting and might be worth a more indepth look when I have some spare time.

[Here&#8217;s][2] a page that talks a bit about Clearsilver and does a brief comparison with some  
of its alternatives.
