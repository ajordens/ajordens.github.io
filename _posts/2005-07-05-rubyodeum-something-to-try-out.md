Well, I haven&#8217;t quite kicked my desire to play more with ruby so I&#8217;m planning a little side project using the Odeum bindings.

It&#8217;s too late to start tonight but I&#8217;ll try to crank something out tomorrow after work.

*Ruby/Odeum is a binding to the fantastic QDBM Odeum inverted index library. Odeum is used in the Estraier search engine and is written by the same author. It lets you easily construct a very fast inverted index so you can search for documents by words really quickly. It is released under the same license as QDBM (LGPL). The source includes the minimum source from QDBM needed to use Odeum, so it will work right out of the box.*
