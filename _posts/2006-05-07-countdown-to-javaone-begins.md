Next weekend I&#8217;ll be in sunny San Francisco getting ready to take in my first JavaOne. We&#8217;re staying in the [Sir Francis Drake][1], which was recommended by one of the guys travelling with us.

There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m actually going to be able to sit in sessions from 8:30 -> 11:30 (counting the BoF&#8217;s) but I did make an attempt to sign up for anything and everything that looks interesting. Plenty of back-end sessions (looking for the Cameron Purdy&#8217;s talks) along with some client-side stuff from Karsten and Romain Guy.

Weather looks good, and it&#8217;ll be nice to finally get to a conference where I&#8217;m not actually performing booth duty in the exhibition hall.
