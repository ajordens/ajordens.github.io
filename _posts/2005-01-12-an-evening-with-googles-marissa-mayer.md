[An evening with Googles Marissa May  
er (alan.blog-city.com)][1]

Alan Williamson has done a good job of keeping notes from the BayCHI talk he went to given by Google&#8217;s Marissa Mayer. It tells an interesting tale of how  
the Google UI (plain as it may be) actually came to fruitation.

I like point #13, *Employees are encouraged to use 20% of their time working on their own projects. Google News, Orkut are both examples of projects tha  
t grew from this working model*.
