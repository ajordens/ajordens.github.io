I&#8217;ve had an mp3 for years now but never really got into podcasts. I listened to [Adam Curry&#8217;s][1] show and [The Java Posse][2] occasionally but nothing much beyond that.

I blogged a few days back about getting an iPod (to replace my defective Creative Zen Micro) and have since found myself digging a bit deeper into the whole podcast/vlog scene using iTunes as my guide (I was a Winamp fan for the longest time but have reached the point of moving on).

Don&#8217;t expect to see me on video any time soon but here&#8217;s what&#8217;s currently in my queue:

  1. [Ask A Ninja][3]
  2. [Diggnation ][4](Small Quicktime)
  3. [Ctrl-Alt-Chicken][5]
  4. [The Java Posse][2]
  5. Attack of the Show Daily Video Podcast
  6. Slashdot Review
  7. Strong Bad Emails &#038; More!
  8. Geek News Central Podcast

I haven&#8217;t seen more than an episode or two of any of these but I must say that **Ask A Ninja** is over the top hilarity. **Ctrl-Alt-Chicken** is quite good as well although there hasn&#8217;t been a new episode in almost 3 months. Rounding out the top 3 is **Diggnation**, it&#8217;s the most techy of the bunch but Alex and Kevin manage to mix in an appropriate amount of comedy.

I know it&#8217;s the holiday season and all, but if you&#8217;re looking for something Java-related check out **The Java Posse**. It&#8217;s a decent collaboration that should keep you aware of what&#8217;s going on in the community.

With the exception of Diggnation, most of the video casts are short 5-10 minute clips. I found listening to an hour long podcast to be a bit tiring. I don&#8217;t really see the point of watching them on a 2&#8243; iPod or Zune display but the video casts are an interesting phenomenon if you can call them that. Why some of these people go to the extent that they do is beyond me.
