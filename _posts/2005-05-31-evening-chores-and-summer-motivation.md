Not really chores, but I&#8217;ve been meaning to get back into the running and working out game. I&#8217;ve been travelling so much lately that its been difficult to eat properly, let alone maintain a consistent gym schedule.

So i&#8217;m going to head out for my second run of the day.

When I get back I&#8217;m going to go sit on my balcony and read a few blogs. It&#8217;s actually a funny story, [Glenn][1], a buddy from work, asked me recently if I had a balcony and if I was sitting out there enjoying the nice weather with the wireless connection. I must admit that I&#8217;ve rarely sat on my balcony in the 3 or 4 years I&#8217;ve lived here. That&#8217;s going to change tonight, I&#8217;ve cleaned off my chair and am going out there tonight rain or shine. Glenn, you hearing this.

After I finish getting caught up on the blogs of interest, I think I might even make an attempt at bringing my resume up to date. I&#8217;ve never really had a reason to keep a resume current, and although I&#8217;m employed, I figure I might as well make an attempt. 

I must admit that the summer weather is motivating. I don&#8217;t know what it is about fall and winter but its terribly demotivating. I find myself just crashing on the couch and sleeping. But now that its spring/early summer, I&#8217;ve started reading again, going to blog more, and try to make life more interesting in general. I now have a reason to leave work at 4:00 (lets not forget that I still carry a laptop so its difficult to truly get away from it, its not my personality to completely turn off work when I leave the office).

I&#8217;ll see how successful I am.
