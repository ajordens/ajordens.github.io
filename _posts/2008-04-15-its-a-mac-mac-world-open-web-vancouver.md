I just got home from [Open Web Vancouver 2008][1] and I must say that MacBook Pro&#8217;s definitely reigned supreme amongst all presenters.

The crowd was slightly more diverse but still plenty of MBPs and even a handful of MacBook Airs.

Keynotes by [Zak Greant][2] and [Tim Bra][3]y were very well received and very much inspirational in their own ways. Kudos if you can [find me][4].

I&#8217;ll blog a bit more about the interesting specifics of the conference in the next day or two. One of the big takeaways for me surrounded [microformats][5] and the emergence of a more semantic web (<span style="font-style: italic;">or at least a more <strong>social</strong> web</span>).
