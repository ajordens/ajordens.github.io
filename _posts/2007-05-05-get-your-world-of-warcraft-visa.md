This just in. First National Bank of Omaha is now issuing World of Warcraft-branded Visa cards.

*Accrue World of Warcraft gametime at the rate of 1% of every dollar in qualifying purchases. The World of Warcraft Rewards Visa is the only card that pays you to play.*

Pretty funny if you ask me. Fortunately (or unfortunately) I live in Canada so likely won&#8217;t be seeing too many of these cards around.
