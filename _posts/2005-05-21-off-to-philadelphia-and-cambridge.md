Well, just went I got comfortable in our new digs, I&#8217;m leaving tomorrow to Philadelphia for a few days and then Boston for a few more days. 

Flying Air Canada this time so we&#8217;ll see how it goes.

On another note, I know I&#8217;m behind the times but I just started using Flickr. I&#8217;ve followed it for a long time but really just haven&#8217;t been much of a phot  
ographer. However, this will all change when I get my coolpix 7900.
