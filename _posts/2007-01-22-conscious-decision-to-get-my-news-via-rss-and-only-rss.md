Over the past few weeks I&#8217;ve undertaken a bit of an experiment.

The goal was simple enough, stop going to any notable news site (abcnews, cnn, cbc, espn, google news, etc.) and instead only receive their content via respective RSS feeds (click-throughs to stories would still obviously take me to an external site).  
It really wasn&#8217;t that difficult but I&#8217;ve been more or less successful.  Honestly I can&#8217;t remember the last time I went to a specific news site.  I believe RSS is a more natural format to receive news in plus it inherently self moderates, most current at the top.  If I spend 20 minutes reading the various feeds throughout the day, I&#8217;m pretty much guaranteed to get a decent snapshot of whats going on in the world without having to wade through a front page littered with the latest backlash against Paris or Britney.

Mind you if I had to pick a single source of news, it&#8217;d be [Google News][1] (Canada).  It&#8217;s aggregated, personalizable and free of ads.  In fact, I&#8217;m browsing the RSS feed right now.
