Well, we&#8217;re not a dot com, but we ([GenoLogics Life Sciences Software][1]) did just move into very nice new office di  
gs. Of course it wasn&#8217;t the first thing we spent the VC money on so I guess that drops us from the .com designation.

It&#8217;s been an interesting two years, seen the company go from 2 employees to 30, $0 in the bank to fairly significant VC investment. Looking forward to the  
future and all the responsibility that&#8217;s going to bring.

We took a bunch of pictures of the old office today and I&#8217;ll post them whenever I get them from Sandy&#8217;s digital camera. I&#8217;ll take some pictures of the new  
office when I get my new coolpix.

Moving sucks tho! We changed phone systems, going from a traditional PBX to VOIP. VOIP is going to be nice but it looks like we have a few wiring mishaps  
so theres a few ports that are in-active and won&#8217;t be usable by developers come monday morning. Fun stuff! Other than that, new desks, dedicated server  
room, kitchen complete with the uber expensive capucino machine (don&#8217;t drink coffee personally so not really a benefit). All that&#8217;s missing is the plasma  
and the futons (and the fountain pop machine from the [success][2] days)
