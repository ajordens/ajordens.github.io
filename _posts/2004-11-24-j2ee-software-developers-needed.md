The software company I work for, [GenoLogics Life Sciences Software][1], is looking for a few qualified software develo  
pers.

We definately do J2EE and would encourage all qualified applicants willing to relocate to the very livable Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We&#8217;re a gro  
wing (and fairly technologically progressive) software company with a strong focus on biotech management software.

A full listing of jobs is available [here][2]. I would be curious to see what kind of applicants a  
blog posting attracts so if you are thinking about applying, feel free to drop me a line or mention where you saw the posting on your application.
