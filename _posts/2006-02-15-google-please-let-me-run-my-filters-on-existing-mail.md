My gmail inbox has admitingly gotten a bit out of hand.

I&#8217;ve got 1200+ (mostly) unfiltered messages sitting in my inbox.

I&#8217;d love to start filtering them, and in fact I have, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a mechanism in place to run a newly created filter over an existing mailbox.  At first I thought I must be missing something because it seems like a pretty standard thing to do so.  However, after finding [this site][1], it seems I&#8217;m not the only one wanting this.

If someone has a solution, please point me in the right direction. Perhaps theres some API that I could access to programatically run a filter over the inbox?
