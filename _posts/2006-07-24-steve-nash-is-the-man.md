I was at the Steve Nash Charity Classic this past Saturday in Vancouver. Overall it was an impressive event with the supporting evidence available [here][1].

The Vancouver Province has excellent [coverge][2] on Steve&#8217;s charity endeavors. In fact, the basketball court that&#8217;s mentioned is just a couple km&#8217;s up to the road.

It&#8217;s nice to see a local kid enjoy his successes but not forget where he came from. It was amazing to see how involved the community was in the event.

The afternoon before the game a city block was cordoned off and a Fan Fest setup with charity booths and various interactive events for kids of all ages. The place was packed!
