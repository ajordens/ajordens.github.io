mazon Developer Conference</a>

It would be nice to work for a large enough company with the resources to make something like this happen. It&#8217;s nice to go to a conference and all, but i  
f you can have some of the speakers come to you, it&#8217;s far less hassle. 

Over the past few days, Amazon invited a group of fairly reknowned speakers to come and speak with their developers on topics ranging from AOP to Halo 2.  
I have not yet read through all the speakers notes but from the couple I have, it looked to be a set of fairly interesting sessions.

Dion Almaer has provided links to the speakers notes on the [Amazon Web Services Blog][1].
