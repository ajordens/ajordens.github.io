The following may not be of interest to you unless you were an avid computer gamer in the early 1990&#8217;s.

For those that don&#8217;t know CGW is short for *Computer Gaming World*, a popular gaming mag from an era where games meant something to the consumer aka. me.

Ok ok, don&#8217;t get me wrong, games still mean something nowadays, but in my opinion you just can&#8217;t relate the Red Barons, Wing Commanders or even Battle of Britians to today&#8217;s current generation of games. They weren&#8217;t necessarily the greatest games but they did define my childhood and because of that the early 90&#8217;s will always be remembered fondly. Likewise, I was an avid CGW reader and for many years I relgiously bought (or more correctly, my dad bought) and read the magazine. Infact, I bet there&#8217;s still shoeboxes upon shoeboxes full of copies sitting in closet somewhere.

It&#8217;s those childhood memories that make the announcement that the entire CGW archive from 1981 thru 2006 is being made [available][1] online in PDf format **pretty damn sweet**! Infact I&#8217;ve just spent the past short while skimming through covers looking for ones I recognize.

Alright, excitement has died down. Time for some shut eye, have plenty of coding to do in the morning.
