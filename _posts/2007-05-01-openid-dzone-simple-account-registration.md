Until now I didn&#8217;t actually have a [DZone][1] account.

However, I do have an OpenID identity.

OpenID + DZone == simple account registration. Creating a DZone account was as simple as entering my identity (from [myOpenID][2]) and giving DZone access to my identity. Quite painless and one less username I have to remember.

In my opinion, this is a direction that online (technically savvy) services should be going. 

For it&#8217;s part, DZone seems to have created a basic account keyed off my open identity. It then prompted me to fill in additional information (email, password, etc.) to complete the registration.

I should note that this last step was not actually necessary. If all I wanted to do was log in and vote, I wouldn&#8217;t need to provide anything beyond the OpenID identity.

The only thing I can&#8217;t seem to do is change my full name?
