Got a couple new pieces of technology for Christmas this year.

  1. 4GB 2nd Generation iPod Nano &#8211; Replaces my on-again off-again Creative Zen Micro.  The Zen was working last week but it seems to be particularly flaky after fixing the headphone connector.  After using the iPod for a day or two, there&#8217;s a reason why Apple dominates the market and I see no reason to jump back to the Creative.
  2. [Logitech Harmony][1] Remote Control &#8211; This is a strange one b/c I don&#8217;t have a lot of equipment.  I&#8217;ve got a TV, HD Receiver and DVD player&#8230; a grand total of 3 remotes.  Nonetheless, the harmony is a pretty cool device that was able to support my devices out of the box.  I didn&#8217;t read the instructions so it was mostly trial by error but it really didn&#8217;t take that long to figure out how things were supposed to work.  It&#8217;s an activity based remote which is rather interesting.  Instead of simply allowing me to operate multiple devices (which is does as well), it provides a mechanism to say &#8216;Watch TV&#8217; which will turn on the TV and Digital Receiver as well as making sure the TV input is set correctly.  Selecting &#8216;Watch DVD&#8217; will make sure the DVD player is on and the TV is set to the correct input.  It seems like a pretty powerful tool of which I&#8217;m barely scratching the surface.
