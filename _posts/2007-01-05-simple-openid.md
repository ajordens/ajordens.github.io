Sam Ruby has a good overview of OpenID ([wikipedia][1]) and the steps required to start identifying yourself. I personally don&#8217;t know much about it but I&#8217;m intrigued to learn more after reading some of the recent press about it.

[OpenID For Non-Superusers][2]

[OpenID Screencast][3]

I&#8217;ve claimed my identity and this blog on technorati using it&#8217;s OpenID interface. Everything worked rather seamlessly. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll install the WordPress plugin that will authorize comments via the protocol. I suspect it&#8217;ll work as expected.

Decentralization is nice, there&#8217;s no reason you can&#8217;t install something like phpMyID and host your identity on a server of your choosing instead of storing it centrally (on a site like myopenid.com). I&#8217;ve yet to do it myself but Sam&#8217;s instructions are simple enough.

*OpenID is increasingly gaining adoption amongst large sites, with organizations like [Technorati][4] both acting as a Relying Party and as a Provider as well as [Wikipedia][5] announcing that they will support OpenID*

Have fun!
