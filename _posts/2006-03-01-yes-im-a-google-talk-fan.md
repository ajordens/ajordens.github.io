I didn&#8217;t really know what to think at first. I signed up, added one person to my contact list, had one conversation, and stopped using it.  
For one, I already had a jabber account (for work IM) and a personal MSN account, not to mention a throw back ICQ account from the old days.

I didn&#8217;t really see the need for yet another IM service, regardless of the technical advantages (or in the case of GoogleTalk&#8217;s initial release, the lack thereof). IMO Google missed the boat with me, it wasn&#8217;t until the integration with GMail that it became useful and actually pretty cool.

I&#8217;m a big fan of its relative simplicity and the centralized archival is a nice side benefit. What I&#8217;d love to see is someone attempt a decent (and long lived) federation across the existing IM services. It&#8217;s cool and all, but I can count the number of chat-enabled people on my contact list with one hand. I don&#8217;t know enough about the Jabber protocols/setup to know if its possible, but from a bit of reading it looks like there has been some effort put into it.

This [post][1] on BigBlueBall talks about using different transports to chat across the other services. It&#8217;s about a month old and looks to preceed the GMail/GTalk integration but it might still work. Unfortunately it sounds like the MSN transport isn&#8217;t the greatest&#8230;
