Jason Kottke posted a list of online games that are sure to keep you busy (and amused) over the holidays.

[Addictive Little Online Games][1]

I can vouch for &#8216;Throw Paper!&#8217; and &#8216;Motherload&#8217;.Â  I haven&#8217;t played many of the others but there&#8217;s probably some other gems in there as well.

Check it out if you feel like wasting some time.
