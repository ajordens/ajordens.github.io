Came across Slide on [business2blog][1].

*Slide is an application you download to your computer. It indexes all of your photos, and then lets you publish albums so that other Slide users can see them, as well as lets you subscribe to albums that other users publish. Without having seen the application myself (the program initially only works on Windows), it sounds like it could be a step forward in that it is both a Web sevice and a desktop app at the same time. It also brings home the point that nearly all media on your desktop (photos today, video tomorrow) will be shared media.*

Sounds a bit like [PiXPO][2], except that PiXPO has already made the leap from photos to video and other forms of media. Is Slide P2P? PiXPO is and it&#8217;s one of their selling points. The company, H2ST, is local and deserves props.

Lots of media sharing going on in British Columbia (Flickr was across the straight in Vancouver, and H2ST is in Victoria).

More news on Slide can be found in this news.com [article][3].

*&#8220;The idea was to encourage her to spend more time with me and less time browsing for shoes,&#8221; he said.* &#8211; **lol**
