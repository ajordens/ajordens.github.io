I&#8217;m sure most of you have already caught this, but Google released a Firefox plugin to solve some of the synchronization issues we all face or have faced in the past.

There&#8217;s a detailed write-up on the plugin [here][1] and FAQs are [available][2].

> Google Browser Sync for Firefox is an extension that continuously synchronizes your browser settings – including bookmarks, history, persistent cookies, and saved passwords – across your computers. It also allows you to restore open tabs and windows across different machines and browser sessions.

A few years back (before I migrated to a laptop that I used at home and in the office) I was using a 3rd party Firefox plugin that effectively ftp&#8217;d my bookmarks to/from a centralized server and had some minimal conflict resolution.

It worked well enough but I think Google has upped the ante a bit, if you can get past the idea of them storing your data (As I see it, they&#8217;ve already got my email which is valuable enough in its own right). Personally I would never synchronize cookies &#038; saved passwords but, if you&#8217;re comfortable with that, it looks like Google will at least encrypt them in some form.
