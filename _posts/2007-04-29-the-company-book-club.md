We&#8217;ve started a book club of sorts at work.

Second book on the ticket (I skipped the first) is [The Search][1]<img style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; MARGIN: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=littlesquare-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" border="0" /> by John Battelle. Amazon gives it a decent review and I&#8217;ve heard of it before but never actually read it. Should be a quick read.

The idea of a company-sponsored book club is interesting.

It sounds a bit like school, we&#8217;re all supposed to read the book by a certain date, than meet over dinner after work one day to discuss. From what I&#8217;ve heard, not everyone completed the first book (a more businessey book I believe) but the general discussion went well. 

With *The* Search I&#8217;m interesting to see if there are any different interpretations of the content (ie. *Google*) by the developers and marketing people in our organization. 

Regardless, I&#8217;ve got to finish [Dreaming in Code][2]<img style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; MARGIN: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none" height="1" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=littlesquare-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" border="0" /> first. Highly recommend it as well, been a good read so far. 

*Like to read, code and play foosball/basketball/soccer? Maybe there&#8217;s a [job][3] for you.*
