> There is a great article with David Kelley, the founder of [Ideo][1], one of the most important design firms in the world, on the Fast Company site. The article touches a bit about Kelley’s life and his battle with cancer, but the article focuses on Kelley’s idea of “Design Thinking”. Designing experiences rather than objects. The read is really great and definitely inspires you to open your thought spectrum up a bit. (via [surfstation][2])
