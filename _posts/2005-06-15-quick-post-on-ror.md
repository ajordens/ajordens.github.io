I played around with [Ruby on Rails][1] tonight for a couple of hours. I guess I&#8217;ve joined the masses now.

It&#8217;s pretty cool. Enuf said. Cool enough to push XUL onto the back burner for the next short whle.

A pretty slick little framework. Simplier than but similar to what I&#8217;m used to in Struts, without the need to maintain an ever changing configuration file. Quite amazing how simple it was to prototype something when the web framework handled the initial pass at form construction. I don&#8217;t have any particularily complicated database relationships (ie. avoiding many-to-many join tables) so scaffolding has worked well so far.

I admit that I&#8217;m just getting into it but I&#8217;ve thought up with a little project involving Flickr and RoR that should force me a little bit deeper into the framework&#8217;s functionality. I should also mention that I was impressed with Scott Raymond&#8217;s insanely easy to use [Ruby wrapper][2] around the Flickr API.

That&#8217;s enough excitement for tonight.
