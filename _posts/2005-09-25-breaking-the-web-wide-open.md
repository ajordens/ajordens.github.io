Marc Canter has penned an AlwaysOn [article][1] discussing the finer points of open API&#8217;s as they relate to today&#8217;s web and its future incarnations. It&#8217;s worth reading if you have an interest in Web 2.0ish commentary.

To provide an opinion on Marc&#8217;s question, *Should they adopt these tools and standards, painfully cannibalizing their existing revenue for a new unproven concept, or should they stick with their currently lucrative model with the risk that eventually a bunch of upstarts eat their lunch?*

I think that the incumbents in area&#8217;s where we&#8217;ve reached critical mass, will open up. Many will be content to let a young startup do the heavy lifting/community building before entering into an acquisition phase. The other direction I see these companies going is further opening of their traditionally walled gardens. They&#8217;ll want to add value for their existing customers so this openness will go both ways, allow others access in while facilitating interoperability with other like-minded services. 

It&#8217;s with the later aspect that open standards really come into play and it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I&#8217;ve played (a bit) with Y! 360 but don&#8217;t really dig it yet. I&#8217;d like to see something truly open where I&#8217;m not forced to start yet another blog or submit data to yet another aggregating service. My data is already out there, provide a meaningful service to build on top of it, not under it.
