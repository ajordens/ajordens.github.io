Interesting [article][1] from the Wharton School of Business about company perks.

The article was interesting more of the same w/ regards to the perks provided by companies like Google.

I&rsquo;ll draw attention to discussion of *Integrators *and *Segmentors*.

> Perks like Google&#8217;s appeal to integrators, people for whom work life and home life have little distinction. These are the employees who like to plug into the wi-fi system on Google&#8217;s commuter bus and do work as they ride to and from the office; who check office e-mail frequently at home on nights and weekends; and who like child-care facilities at or near their office so that they can bring a part of home with them to work.
> 
> Segmentors, by contrast, like to maintain distinct walls between work and home. These are people made uncomfortable by a workplace filled with perks related to one&#8217;s personal life. Even employees with children can dislike the fact that their employer provides on-site childcare.

  It&rsquo;s important to note that an integrator is no better an employee than a segmentor.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a time and place for both.

  Personally, I&rsquo;m an integrator.&nbsp;

<p dir="ltr">
  I&rsquo;m young and enjoy what I do but there are plenty of times when I wish I could easily separate my home and work lives, it&rsquo;s difficult.&nbsp; And that&rsquo;s just me being an employee of a Company that doesn&rsquo;t provide a lot of perks.&nbsp; A laptop and free pop/dinners (if you&rsquo;re there late) is about as far as it goes, but I&rsquo;m happy.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being in such a perk-filled environment as Google (or companies like it) provides.
