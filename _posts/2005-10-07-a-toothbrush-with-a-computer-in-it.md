Any one want to tell me why we need a [toothbrush][1] with a computer in the handle? Maybe we should encourage Apple to stick a few bristles on the nano and call it a Tooth-pod. 

It&#8217;s bad enough that we need batteries, and a razor sharing its name with an expensive BMW coupe, to get a good shave in the morning.
