See [Creative Zen Micro Headphone Jack Fix][1]

I&#8217;ve had my zen micro for a little under 2 years and have been plagued by rather annoying headphone jack problems every 6 or 7 months. I say every 6 months because the first time I managed to have Creative repair it free of charge, but the second time Creative wanted $13 to talk to their support line about paying for a repair. I&#8217;ve been forced to run holding the connection in place for the past 4 months.

Now, out of principle, I&#8217;d rather not pay for hardware that breaks regularly for others and isn&#8217;t particularly denied by Creative support folk (the last email correspondence ended with someone recommending that I try twisting and holding the headphone connection in place).

I&#8217;m not really an Apple fanatic, so the [Sandisk Sansa][2] looks appealing if and when I end up deciding to make another purchase. Anyone have experience with it?

It looks like Costco has it, an added bonus for nothing more than a convienent return policy.
