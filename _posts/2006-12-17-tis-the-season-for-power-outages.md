I&#8217;m sure everyone is well aware of the storms that have been hitting the west coast of Canada but the past couple weeks have been particularly bad.

We&#8217;ve been without power at work a few times in the past couple of weeks (not so good for a technology company) and there&#8217;s a lot of trees down around town.  My parents have been without power for 3 days now but I guess that&#8217;s the price you pay for living in a green area.  Luckily I live in a fairly well-connected (power-wise) part of town that isn&#8217;t that prone to power loss even if the rest of the city is.  
The good thing about snowy conditions is 4&#215;4&#8217;n.  We went out the other day about an hour up Vancouver Island and quickly ran into a lot of snow and downed trees.  Fortunately there was a land cruiser with a winch powerful enough to move things out of the way.  Pretty fun day, definitely a benefit of living on the island.  
Who knows how long this is going to last, I suspect it&#8217;ll clear up soon and reports are calling for rain throughout the next wee.  No white Christmas or birthday for me.
