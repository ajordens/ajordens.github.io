[About Google Video][1]

Been looking around Google Video for the past couple minutes. It&#8217;s the new service from Google Labs that is geared towards letting you search the closed c  
aption text listings from TV shows. It&#8217;s still in testing so who knows where/what this will materialize into in terms of the google&#8217;s regular searching ca  
pabilities. Sure there&#8217;s a lot of TV material that could be indexed, do I have an immediate need for it, no I don&#8217;t think so. 

It&#8217;ll be interesting to see where this goes and what kind of commercial partnership support there is for such an endeavor. Someone mentioned a similar ser  
vice in [TV Tome][2] which seems to capture people&#8217;s tv show reviews. 

from **About Google Video**:  
*Just type in your search term (for instance, ipod or Napa Valley) or do a more advanced search (for instance, title:nightline) and Google Video will se  
arch the closed captioning text of all the programs in our archive for relevant results. Click on a program title on your results page and you can look thr  
ough short snippets of the text along with still images from the show. Visit the &#8220;About this show&#8221; side panel to learn when this show will air next.
