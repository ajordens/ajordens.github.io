I thought about this a short while back but until now haven&#8217;t had time to write a post about it.

What I would like to see is an integration between google maps and the current/historic weather conditions for an area. By weather conditions I&#8217;m referring to something cool like a doppler radar overlay mixed with meta-data from a site like weather.com or wunderground.com. Extensions could also include graphical wind conditions, clouds, visibility, etc. 

On a related note, I&#8217;d love to see the possibility for traffic patterns (historic and current) to be overlayed onto a map. I read somewhere that google has acquired [zipdash.com][1] which may actually make this latter suggestion a reality. Hopefully they don&#8217;t ignore Canada.

I envy the google engineers that get to work on projects like these. The problem space is particularily interesting not necessarily because the technology is cutting edge but rather because the possibilities are endless. Exactly the type of problems I like to work on.
