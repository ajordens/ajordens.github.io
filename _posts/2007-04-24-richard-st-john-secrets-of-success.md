*Why do people succeed? Because they&#8217;re smart? Or lucky? How about: Neither. Inspired by a chance encounter with a high school student who asked him how to become a success, St. John interviewed more than 500 successful people, then distilled what they told him into eight simple principles.*

See Richard&#8217;s [4 minute talk][1] at the 2005 [TED][2] (Technology, Entertainment, Design) conference. Richard, the author of *Stupid, Ugly, Unlucky and RICH*, relates success to 8 (rather basic) ideas. Of interesting note are the accompanying comments he&#8217;s gathered during 500+ interviews with successful people over the past 10 years. 

*It&#8217;s not always easy to push yourself, that&#8217;s why they invented mothers.*

On a semi-related note, there&#8217;s another [Freakonomics][3] book [in the works][4].
