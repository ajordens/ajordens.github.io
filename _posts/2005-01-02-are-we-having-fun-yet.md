Haven&#8217;t had time to blog in over a month. Actually I did have a series of vacation days in December but you know how those tend to play out with a startup  
. It has been an entertaining attempt getting through a seemingly endless pile of holiday season blog posts. 

I agree for the most part with Adam Bosworth&#8217;s [We all stand on the shoulders of giants][1]. We  
have been building on the foundations of others for generations, no industry can argue against this. We&#8217;re lazy software developers, why would we want to  
re-implement memory management routines or layout managers. Sure this is required in some situations, but for the most part we should be encouraging re-u  
se. There&#8217;s a reason why Java and C# have been successful, they make developer&#8217;s lives easier by providing an extensive foundation framework. In my most  
recent experience, we wouldn&#8217;t be successful if we couldn&#8217;t leverge the work of others. It speeds development and increases the likelyhood that a young  
companies is able to market (in a timely and anticipated fashion). 

I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the job of a corporation to &#8220;give back&#8221; in a way dictated by any one group of end users. Google is out to make a profit, and a side-eff  
ect of them making this profit is providing web searches, desktop searches, newsgroup searches, library searches&#8230;.you name it. Likewise for the Yahoo&#8217;s,  
Jeeves and even MS searches. Should we expect the employees of these companies to give back to the communities? It would be nice but I&#8217;d be happy with c  
ontinued innovation in the respective fields of expertise and the continued availability of free services. 

Hey Google, I&#8217;m tired of paying for software X, can you buy that company and make the software free&#8230;. <img src="http://littlesquare.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Would be nice wouldn&#8217;t it.
