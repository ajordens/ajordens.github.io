This past week I&#8217;ve started using [Synergy][1] again. For those that haven&#8217;t heard of it before, Synergy is a software-based KVM application that allows you easily share a keyboard and mouse amongst multiple computers using a TCP/IP connection I first used the tool a couple years back but the most recent release was in April of 2006. 

In the past I&#8217;ve tended to have nothing but problems with cheap (perhaps that&#8217;s the problem) hardware KVMs (power outages or system shutdowns). Instead of using cables, Synergy tunnels everything over TCP/IP and generally works as expected. I had a few inconsistencies in some applications when sharing from Linux -> Windows but vice-versa works like a charm. No problems crossing between computers from within Warcraft either <img src="http://littlesquare.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

I&#8217;ve been running the server on a Windows XP laptop and the client on Ubutu &#8216;Fiesty Fawn&#8217;. In this configuration my laptop&#8217;s keyboard and mouse are shared transparent with Ubuntu. 

It&#8217;s really quite nice so if you happen to be messing around with KVM-cables and the like, stop and check out [Synergy][1]. It&#8217;s open-source, available via Sourceforge and might just be exactly what you need.
