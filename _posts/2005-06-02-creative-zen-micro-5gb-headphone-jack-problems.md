I bought a 5GB Zen Micro on January 29th, 2005. I&#8217;ve been quite happy with it until the last couple of days when I started having problems with a loose headphone jack. I bought it over an ipod but I may be regretting my decision. I also just bought my girlfriend a rio carbon 5GB player for $200cdn, not quite on par with the micro&#8217;s UI/L&#038;F, but about a third cheaper.

I&#8217;m not the only one having these issues, there are numerous message board threads ([one][1],[two][2],[three][3],[four][4]) that describe other peoples experiences with this problem.

It&#8217;s a great little unit but a hardware defect like this is unacceptable to me after only having it for 5 months. It hasn&#8217;t been dropped, and lives in a nice Nike running case. 

I have an email into Creative support to see how best to rectify the situation. I actually bought it from Futureshop but they tend to have difficulties supporting their products unless of course you purchased their $69 extended warranty. I don&#8217;t actually expect to have Creative do much to solve my problems (unlike Toby from Yahoo! who was totally on the ball after I had problems signing up for an account). I&#8217;m posting this information to let everyone know that I&#8217;m yet another person having the loose headphone jack problem. 

If anyone from Creative (support or otherwise) actually reads this and feels like sending a response, it would be most appreciated. I&#8217;ll update this post if I ever hear anything back and who knows, might just have good news.
