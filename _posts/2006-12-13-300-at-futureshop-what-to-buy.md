  * Wii
  * XBox
  * XBox 360
  * PS2
  * iPod (to replace my on-again off-again Creative Zen Micro)

Finally decided to cash in some credit card points for Futureshop gift certificates and have yet to decide what to buy.

I&#8217;ve already got the Plasma TV (and La-z Boy recliner) so I&#8217;m covered on that front.  I did buy a Game Cube at it&#8217;s launch but never really played it.  It&#8217;s because of this that I&#8217;m weary of buying yet another console particularly something like a PS3.   Although I am thinking it might be nice to mod an original xbox or perhaps pickup Katamari &#8216;Garbage Ball&#8217; Damacy for the PS2.
