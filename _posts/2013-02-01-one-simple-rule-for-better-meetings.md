<span style="">Witnessed this again first hand last week, and although this is well known it&#8217;s been rare to see in practice.</span>

  <div>
    <span style="">Hold your meeting in a room <em style="font-weight: bold;">just</em> big enough to fit the required participants <strong><em>while standing</em></strong>. </span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style=""><br /></span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="">There should be a white board on one wall (</span><em style="">at least</em><span style="">), projection on the front wall, and a narrow standing height table in the middle. The only person with a laptop </span><strong style="">should be the facilitator</strong><span style="">. Having a narrow table discourages everyone from bringing their own device, which in-turn puts the emphasis on whatever topic was important enough to bring 4 or 5 people together. </span><span style=""><br /></span>

    <span style=""><br /></span>
  </div>

  <div>
    <span style="">Mix up the focal points during the meeting, don&#8217;t just stand around in a circle naval gazing. </span><span style="">Remember meetings suck, and most of the time, participants would rather be back at their desk doing &#8220;real&#8221; work.  </span>

<div style="">
  <span style="">By reducing square footage, you&#8217;re increasing the likelihood of physical (<em>and I mean actual touching, drawing, etc.</em>) interaction with both the projector screen and white board. Not to mention that meetings will often end earlier, you&#8217;ve reached diminishing returns when the interaction begins dying off, that&#8217;s when it&#8217;s time to vacate.</span>

  <span style="">Have you tried something similar with your team, how did it work out?</span>
