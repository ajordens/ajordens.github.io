I was in Mexico a couple weeks ago and I come back to [this][1]&#8230;

The first snow storm of the year happened yesterday and it was pretty rough by Victoria standards. The city was essentially shutdown today, no buses, no university, and no work for me.

I may live in Canada, but I don&#8217;t live in Alberta, Ontario or Quebec. The mild west coast is supposed to be exactly that.. mild. Luckily snow doesn&#8217;t tend to stay long around here and hopefully it&#8217;ll clear up by tomorrow.
