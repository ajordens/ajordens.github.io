**Happy Canada Day**

Finished re-reading Effective Java last week so I picked up two new books in Boston. Started reading *The Design of Things To Come* on the trip back from Cambridge. Pretty good book so far, not directly related to my development work but provides an interesting perspective on areas I&#8217;m interested in. *Head First Design Patterns* also looks good but I haven&#8217;t dug into it too much yet. 

Not to mention I&#8217;m still working through one of the *The Pragmatic Programmer* books as well. Good thing there&#8217;s nothing else to do on a plane but read.
