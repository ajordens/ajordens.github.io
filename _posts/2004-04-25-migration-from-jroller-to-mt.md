I have, in the past hour, decided to make the switch from using a remotely hosted <a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/project" target=_new>Roller<  
/a> instance (from the good guys at <a href="http://www.jroller.com" target=_new>JRoller.com</a>) to a locally installled instance of <a href="http://www.m  
ovabletype.org" target=_new>MovableType</a>. I&#8217;ve been wanting to try out MT for sometime and finally decided to take the plunge. I probably won&#8217;t bother  
to migrate my previous posts (there&#8217;s not too many of them anyways).

MovableType looks to be a pretty slick system and I look forward to playing with it. Good work <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/" target=_new>SixApart</a>  
.

Now all I have to do is get my blogroll imported and we&#8217;ll be set.
