Anyone have experience with the tool FireStorm/DAO ?

*FireStorm/DAO makes Java software developers more productive by automatically generating Java source code for accessing relational databases. The benefits provided by CodeFutures Java code generation approach are higher developer productivity, better software quality, reduced complexity, and lower maintenance costs.*

Basically it helps ease ones pain associated with creating a DAO tier off an already existing database. It supports generating hibernate .hbm models which is interesting, anyone actually using it or has used it successfully (or unsuccessfully) in the past?

I&#8217;m wondering how it stacks up to the regular DB reverse engineering tools (inc. the new hibernate tools, middlegen?, etc.). The automated DAO tier would be nice but it&#8217;s not that terribly difficult to build a generic crud dao tier.
