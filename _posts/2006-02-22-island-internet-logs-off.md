I started working at Island Internet when I was 15 years (and spend 4 years there before heading off to University), that&#8217;s almost 11 years ago and nearly as long as the company has been providing its services to the island. It looks like the inevitable has happened, cable and dsl connections has overtaken traditional dialup internet service on the Island. Web hosting and other auxiliary services just aren&#8217;t enough to support a company like Island Internet.

I learned a lot from Daniel Rogers, James Bourne and the rest of the gang. It was pretty good times and great first work experience. I still remember spending that first day with Herb in the server room. They didn&#8217;t really have a desk for me, so I just took over his desk which happened to be in the server room.

Customer support taught me a lot, not my desired career, but a good introduction to complex systems and customer demands.

Sad to see it go.
