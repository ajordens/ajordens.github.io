A friend just pointed out a post over on [Wired Science][1] that talks a bit more about Google&#8217;s (previously) announced plans to begin providing infrastructure to enable scientists to more easily share and collaborate on large volumes of data.

It&#8217;ll be interesting to see where this goes. Giving scientists access to large volumes of data is an important first step, providing a means to build pipelines and frameworks on top of it is another.

If there&#8217;s anyone that could pull something like this off on a global scale it&#8217;s Google.
