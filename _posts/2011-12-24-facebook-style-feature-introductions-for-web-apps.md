Onver the last short while, I&#8217;ve been putting together a new service aimed at delivering Facebook-style feature introductions to any web application/site.

You know, the little step-by-step walkthroughs of what&#8217;s new/changed.

In the interest of being lean, I&#8217;ve been focusing on getting a simple foundation in-place and building it out based on personal needs and feedback from the community.

 

**The ONE Feature Introduction**:  <http://onesecondshy.com/one-feature-introductions>

The ONE Feature Introduction walks a user through particular features or aspects of your site.

Think of it as a guided tour that helps ensure your users can effectively use your application.

 

At this point, I&#8217;m looking to broaden my reach and gather the next round of feedback as well as getting it rolled out and active on additional sites.

From the development side, it&#8217;s a fairly simple low-touch integration.  That being said, I&#8217;m more than willing to jump in and answer any questions / ensure that the integration remains as simple as possible.

So if you build web applications, or run a site with regular content updates, [**I&#8217;d love to talk more**.][1]

Happy Holidays!
