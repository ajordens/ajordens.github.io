Up until yesterday I was the guy you saw huddled in the corner at Starbucks basking in the pale glow of an iPhone 3G. 

Everyone around me had upgraded, at \_least\_ to a 3GS, but my unwillingness to give the Canadian carriers any more money (*early upgrade fees*) kept me dated. 

That is until yesterday when an unlocked 32GB 4S showed up on my door step, and I must say that the difference is remarkable&#8230; unbelievable really. 

So it&#8217;s with pleasure that I can now dust off instagram, yelp, rdio, twitter, runkeeper and facebook on the phone. Constant crashes on the 3G basically forced me to use the phone as&#8230; a phone, for calls and text messages. 

On the iOS 5 front, it&#8217;s definitely breathed new life into my trusty iPad (mind you I was running 4.2 previously). 

Split keyboard, tabbed browsing, wifi sync and personal wifi hotspots to the rescue. 

That&#8217;s it for now.
