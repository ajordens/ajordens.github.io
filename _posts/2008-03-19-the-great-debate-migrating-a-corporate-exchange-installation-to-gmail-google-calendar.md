A rather humorous debate has started in the office around mail and calendaring solutions. Humorous because everyone running Windows loves Exchange and doesn&#8217;t see what the big deal is.

We&#8217;re a software shop with about 1/3 (of ~50) of the employees being in development. Most developers have recently migrated (from Linux/XP) to OS X. Windows has been and will always be the defacto OS of choice for non-developers. It&#8217;s the unfortunate truth in any corporate environment I&#8217;ve seen.

Now for the past couple of years we&#8217;ve been plugging along w/ Exchange. It&#8217;s satisfactory enough for the Windows users but really leaves a lot to desire for anyone else.

The ability to book resources <span style="font-style: italic;">(meeting rooms primarily)</span> has always been a major sticking point. It works acceptably well using Outlook but rather terribly via. the webmail interface. Unfortunately, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mail.app</span> on the Mac doesn&#8217;t do much other than e-mail. A few people are using <span style="font-style: italic;">Entourage 2004</span> but I&#8217;ve yet to make the plunge. At least w/ <span style="font-style: italic;">Entourage</span> I could install <span style="font-style: italic;">Google Desktop</span> and get a nicer search interface.

Essentially there&#8217;s a <span style="font-style: italic;">(significant?)</span> divide between the different parts of the organization. From a strictly personal perspective, my exchange calendar is almost never up to date and it doesn&#8217;t bother me. I grab mail using <span style="font-style: italic;">Mail.app</span> and accept meetings in <span style="font-style: italic;">iCal</span>. Unless I make a special trip to the webmail interface, exchange is never going to know I accepted/rejected the meeting request. Honestly, I&#8217;ve got more important things to do. Do people expect me to have a current calendar&#8230; probably&#8230; and therein lies the rub.

Throw a VPN into the mix and it&#8217;s a rare occurrence that I can send mail using anything other than the webmail interface when I&#8217;m not in the office. <span style="font-style: italic;">This particular problem is probably more VPN configuration than a problem w/ Exchange.</span>

**There has to be something better?**

I can say without a doubt that I&#8217;d love to see us switch to Google Apps for Enterprise. The suggestion has been put forth by numerous people but I&#8217;m doubtful that the rest of the organization can be convinced of its benefits.

Failing a mass migration away from exchange, I suspect we&#8217;ll see more people (myself included) running Entourage.

<span style="font-style: italic;">Any other alternatives?</span>
