I&rsquo;m going to experiment&nbsp;with various forms of off-line posting.&nbsp; Although the WordPress posting interface is nice it does occasionally mess up formatting.

I&rsquo;m going to try BlogJet (and possibly Ecto) for a couple of weeks to see how they stack up.

The ability to compose ad hocly and publish later is nice and lends itself to a desktop client.&nbsp; Being able to collect my thoughts prior to publishing might just improve my writing.&nbsp; If nothing else my spelling should improve.

I&rsquo;ve also upgraded to&nbsp;WordPress 2.1.2.&nbsp; As part of the upgrade I spent a bit of time looking at&nbsp;alternative themes.&nbsp; The latest [Eli Forner][1]&nbsp;offering is nice but doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;appear to be publicly available.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s built on the popular [5ThirtyOne V2][2] theme.&nbsp; I did play around with the 5ThirtyOne theme for a bit tonight but wasn&rsquo;t able to suitably customize it so I&rsquo;ll be living with *2813 *for a little while longer.
