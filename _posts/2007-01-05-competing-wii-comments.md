  * Great system. Very entertaining. Low learning curve. Virtual console has some good classic games.
  * This is an okay system. First of all, it is very hard to use, and especially hard to get used too, especially if you have been using a classic shape controller beforehand. The graphics are okay, but what could you expect from a cheap system. The games are incredible, especially zleda twighlight princess, but the controls are close to impossible. Its very annoying to use the add on nunchuk controller, which makes moving easier but is still very difficult.
  * This is a great console! It is the best on the market that can work for the whole family!
  * This system is awesome it might be a lot of money but who cares it is really fun!!!
  * This is okay although other systems are better.
  * It&#8217;s great although I wish it had high definition.

Pretty humorous. Absolute love and hatred towards the console. I don&#8217;t own one yet but I&#8217;m still considering getting one once they&#8217;re more widely available (meaning I can walk into Futureshop and buy one).
