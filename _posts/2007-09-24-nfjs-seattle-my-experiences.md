This past weekend the development team (all 18 of us) traveled down to Seattle for the annual Pacific Northwest Software Symposium (aka. NFJS Seattle).  Jay and the gang always do a great job with the tour and this year was no exception.  Much fun was had by all.

This was my third consecutive year at the conference and as always I left feeling motivated and better informed.  Ted Neward gave an excellent keynote on language development and what the next five years holds for developers (*Why the next five years will be about languages)*.  I believe it was the same keynote that he gave at [Jazoon07][1] and it was definitely well received here as well.

Day 1 was basically all Ted Neward.  I went to his talks on Classloaders and debugging.  The classloaders talk was excellent, debugging was interesting but the presented material was more of a refresher for me.  

Day 2 was all over the map.  Started out w/ Jason Hunters overview on Java6.  We&#8217;re waiting on official Java6 support for the Mac but it&#8217;s helpful to be aware of what will be available when we do migrate.  Venkat Subramaniam gave a couple of excellent talks about Fit/FitNesse and Java Annotations (*Annotation Hammer).  *Brian Goetz gave another talk on the Java Memory Model (saw it last year and thought it was excellent).

Day 3 was half Groovy and half concurrency.  There was a lot of talk at the conference around alternative JVM-based languages with Groovy being at the forefront of most conversations.  I&#8217;m looking forward to playing more with these dynamic languages (*we&#8217;ve just completed a basic integration of Jython)*.  Brian Goetz gave a couple of talks around using concurrency effectively and structuring Java applications for concurrency.  Unfortunately we had to skip out early to (try and) catch a ferry so I only caught half of the *Effective Concurrent Java* talk.

Unfortunately the worst part of the trip came post conference.  We gave ourselves ~4hrs to get from Seattle to the ferry terminal in Vancouver.  Should have been plenty of time.  Unfortunately we miscalculated the effect of the high Canadian dollar on day trippers.  We hit severe grid lock about a mile from the crossing and sat for a few hours.  Eventually we gave up on the 9:00 ferry to Victoria and had dinner in Blaine, WA. Afterwards we managed to merge back into the border lineup and did make the 11:00 sailing to Nanaimo (about 1.5hrs north of Victoria).  So after about ~10hrs of travelling we made it home!

None the less it was totally worth the trip.  The conference was great, as were the extra cirricular activities. 

We actually have an internal hack day planned for next week so it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how many people take some of the material from NFJS and put it into practice.
