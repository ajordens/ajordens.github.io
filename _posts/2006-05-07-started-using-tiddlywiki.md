A year or so back I experimented with TiddlyWiki but didn&#8217;t really get beyond that.

I&#8217;ve since taken it up again as an attempt to become better organized. We use Confluence at work and I&#8217;ve experiemented with having a personal space where I can record my ToDo&#8217;s and other misc. pieces of information. It&#8217;s nice but requires me to be either on the network or at least vpn&#8217;d in. Basically, I want an information store that will \_always\_ be available, with or without an Internet connection.

Not ideal in all circumstances.

*Enter TiddlyWiki*

> A free <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">MicroContent</span> <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">WikiWikiWeb</span> created by <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">JeremyRuston</span> and a busy <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">Community</span> of independent developers. It&#8217;s written in HTML, CSS and <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting">JavaScript</span> to run on any modern browser without needing any <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">ServerSide</span> logic. It allows anyone to create personal <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">SelfContained</span> hypertext documents that can be posted to a <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkNonExisting">WebServer</span>, sent by email or kept on a USB thumb drive to make a <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">WikiOnAStick</span>. It also makes a great <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">GuerillaWiki</span>. This is revision 2.0.10 of <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">TiddlyWiki</span>, and is published under an <span class="tiddlyLink tiddlyLinkExisting">OpenSourceLicense</span>.

Prior to today, my strategy of organization has consisted of Jira (our bug tracker) tasks, Firefox bookmarks, Confluence entries, del.icio.us tags along with various email reminders.

My medium-term goal is to rid myself of most firefox bookmarks (the to-read ones), del.icio.us tags, and email reminders. My del.icio.us feed has become populated with hundreds upon hundreds of links and I&#8217;m finding it difficult to track things down.

TiddlyWiki looks like it could be a solution to the problem, I think the only barrier is me finding time to actually make use of it. It&#8217;s also nice that it doesn&#8217;t involve any server-side logic and thus I can copy and backup easily.

In closing, I must say that even if I don&#8217;t continue using TiddlyWiki, it&#8217;s at least an interesting application of recent (and not-so-recent) web technologies.
