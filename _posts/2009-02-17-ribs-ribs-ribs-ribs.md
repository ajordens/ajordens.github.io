Glenn, if you’re reading this, we’re doing it again.

…

About [4 years ago][1], some friends and I decided to venture down to the neighborhood rib house for some an **all-you-can-eat rib** spectacle.&#160; 

It’s taken us awhile (*years really, some even had to leave the country*) to recover, but this time we’ll be **29** [co-workers][2] strong.&#160; 

The plan is to round everyone up and head to the saloon (*yes, bonus points again because the place has saloon in it’s name*) for a feast after work.&#160; Should be a night to remember, everyone has been encouraged to wear a white shirt and make a mess of it.&#160; 

Food (*and drink*) is always a good bonding experience, so all-you-can-eat must be even better, right?

&#160;

I’ll post an update after the fact, should have some better pictures this time as well.&#160; If nothing else, ghetto iPhone photos will have to do us justice.&#160;
