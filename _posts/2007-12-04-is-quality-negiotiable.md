A colleague pointed out an interesting article over on InfoQ aptly titled [Is Quality Negotiable][1].

Obviously if you&#8217;ve ever written a line of code or used a piece of software this question has been implicitly or explicitly answered for you.

It&#8217;s fundamentally important that both individuals and organizational groups have a clear understanding of what quality means to them.  There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that quality means very different things to different people but taken together that&#8217;s part of achieving a successful balance.  Debate is healthy and it&#8217;s important that you stay true to your core beliefs, be they *writing unit tests* or *ensuring each release has suitable* *user documentation*.  You can&#8217;t satisfy everyone but by talking through a problem or having concerns answered, a clear set of priorities and direction will be established.

As a developer, I believe quality is negotiable, it simply has to be.  Much to the same degree as a feature should be negotiable.  My personal philosophy on development would always be to release less features of a higher ***perceived*** quality then more features of slightly lesser quality (*the old 100% of 80 or 80% of 100 problem*) but I&#8217;ve come to understand that there&#8217;s a time and place for both.  Deadlines are a reality but there&#8217;s a balance that **must** be struck between tactical and strategic thinking.  

Focus too much on the tactical aspects of development and release planning and chances are you&#8217;ll be left with a pile of technical debt and a team of unhappy people jumping from project to project.  If you&#8217;re really good, there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;ll have a few satisfied customers.  The early days of a start-up are often very tactical in nature, they have to be, but it takes a heroic effort across the board and is very difficult to maintainable in the long run. Tactical thinking is a reality and it&#8217;s important to make people aware of the costs associated with making short-term decisions.

Focus too much on strategic thinking and you&#8217;ll be hard pressed to ever build a realistic release plan let alone get features into customers hands that actually perform how they expect them to.  Truth be told, you&#8217;ll still accumulate technical debt.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I value strategic thinking and it&#8217;s a big part of what I do on a regular basis, but it should be relatable back to reality.

There&#8217;s an important balance to be struck and it goes beyond the code, the cost of doing business, or even the customer.  It&#8217;s been said many times before but quality is not magic *nor* is it something that can tacked on at the end of a project.  Further to that, the waterfalls froze a long time ago and it&#8217;s equally important in todays environments to remain flexible and open to change. Quality should be considered a characteristic of the process that went into creating the product and the act of managing that process is **difficult** at the best of times.
