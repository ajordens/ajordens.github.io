My buddy [Glenn ][1]is actively travelling in India right now so I thought I&#8217;d post this Wired article about Pharmaceutical&#8217;s using India as a clinical test bed. We both work in Bio-IT and although we&#8217;re not directly involved in drug discovery, we do develop tools to help track and analyze researcher&#8217;s data.

[Testing Drugs on India&#8217;s Poor][2]

I wonder how much of it is true and just what can be done to stop it. In today&#8217;s global marketplace and given the emergence of India as an educated yet poverty-stricken nation, I don&#8217;t see why large pharma wouldn&#8217;t take the 60% cost savings and do a trial in India. Clinical trials are expensive and given that only a small percentage of them are successful, you&#8217;re forced to be operate efficiently. 

The article goes on to mention that clincial trial exports to India are expected to top $2 billion by 2010. 

> In 2004, two India-based pharmaceutical companies, Shantha Biotech in Hyderabad and Biocon in Bangalore, came under scrutiny for conducting illegal clinical trials that led to eight deaths.

> In another incident, Sun Pharmaceuticals convinced doctors to prescribe Letrozole, a breast cancer drug, to more than 400 women as a fertility treatment in a covert clinical trial &#8212; and used the results to promote the drug for the unapproved use.

Neither of those stories sound very good. You&#8217;ve got pharmaceutical companies inticing relatively poor and &#8220;treatment na√Øve,&#8221; people. Not a very good recipe for discovery and clinical testing of drugs that are going to be sold and distributed in the global marketplace.
