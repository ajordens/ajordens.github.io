A couple weeks back I made a trip down to Seattle in search of an iPad. BestBuy was a complete bust, they get ~10 units in per week and quickly sell out. If you really want one, you&#8217;re going to have to visit an actual Apple store.

That same weekend, I also picked up a Netbook for the girlfriend. It was a much easier buying experience, they&#8217;re everywhere. We ended up picking up an Acer from Costco for $499.

First things first, the iPad is not a laptop replacement IMO. It&#8217;s certainly sexy and crowd pleasing, but if you&#8217;re looking for a communication device in the sense of sending emails, video conferencing, etc., you&#8217;re better off with a Netbook (MacBook Air included). The virtual keyboard is passable, but not terribly suited to significant correspondence. Plan on grabbing the Apple bluetooth keyboard if you&#8217;re looking to publish content via the iPad. Lastly, if you&#8217;re the attention seeking type sporting a permanently popped collar, the iPad is a surefire crowd attractor. &nbsp;&nbsp;

On the flip-side, if you&#8217;re looking for a new content consumption device (twitter, google reader, books, etc.) it really is your ticket to ride. I&#8217;ve been running a little test over the past couple weeks where I&#8217;ve restricted Twitter and RSS usage to the iPad. It&#8217;s completely anecdotal, but it seems much easier to keep up to date on the iPad versus say using Tweetie or Google Reader on the MBP.

The Flash argument is a non-starter for me, 99% of the sites I access on a regular basis are fine. Once FailBlog converts over to HTML5, I&#8217;ll be set.

Furthermore, just being able to sit on the couch or lay in bed and not end up with a **3rd degree burn**, makes the iPad worth the price of admission.

*As I type this, the girlfriend is happily skyping with friends and tagging faces in Picasa. Being able to do both at the same time is an obviously technological and patentable marvel!*
