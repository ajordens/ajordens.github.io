Although I&#8217;ve been an IBM PC owner/user since the age of 3, I can respect what Jef Raskin, a human computer interaction expert amongst other things, did f  
or the industry through his invovlement in the development of what was to become the Mac. 

Jef Raskin was the 31st employee of Apple and passed away today of cancer at the age of 61. No one should argue the impacts that the early Mac had on real  
ly driving and improving human computer interaction. 

From [abcnews][1]:  
*While best known in the computer industry, Raskin also pursued other interests. He conducted the San Francisco Chamber Opera Society and played three i  
nstruments. His artwork was displayed at New York&#8217;s Museum of Modern Art. He also received a patent for airplane wing construction.</p> 

He was an accomplished archer, target shooter and occasional race car driver, friends said.

&#8220;He believed in having fun, too,&#8221; Burstein said. &#8220;The people who worked with him at Apple talk about how important were the toys and the games and the sens  
e of joy that he demanded.&#8221;</em>
