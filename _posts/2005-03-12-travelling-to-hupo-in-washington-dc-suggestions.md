So I&#8217;ve spent the majority of today travelling from Victoria BC to Washington DC for the Human Proteome Organization conference.

After 2 days of exhibiting I&#8217;m off to Cambridge, Boston to visit a customer. Anyone have suggestions on what I should do in Cambridge/Boston?

The travelling was actually not as bad as I expected. Seatac was rather efficient and I didn&#8217;t even have time to make it worthwhile getting wireless net a  
ccess. I did sign up for T Mobile wireless access in the Hyatt I&#8217;m staying at and it seems to be working alright. 

Regan International on the other hand looks like one big mess (IMHO). It&#8217;ll be an interesting experience when I go to leave for Boston on Tuesday.

Anyways, I&#8217;m sitting in a Hyatt near regan interational. It&#8217;s saturday night and there is absolutely nothing to do in &#8220;Crystal City&#8221;. Talked to the fron  
t desk, no go. I imagine (and I&#8217;m hoping) that Cambridge, being a college town and all, will be a little bit more exciting. 

I pre-loaded my zen micro with all kinds of podcasts to listen to on the flight over. Turns out we had a 100mph tailwind and we got here almost an hour ea  
rlier so I couldn&#8217;t fit everything in. I flew Alaska and rented one of their $10 personal dvd players. I&#8217;d recommend it to anyone, ended up watching Wal  
l Street and half of the incredibles. I&#8217;ll rent it again on the way home and watch the rest of the incredibles and maybe something else.

Trade show doesn&#8217;t start until Monday but we have to setup our display booth tomorrow and attend the opening schmooze. I don&#8217;t know how I got manipulated  
into doing this trade show appearance but I had to go to Boston anyways so it was convienent I guess.
