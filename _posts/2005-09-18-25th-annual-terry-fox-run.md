Just got home from participating in the 25th Annual Terry Fox Run.

Was a nice day for a run, reason enough to get me out of bed earlier than the customary 10 or 11:00 wake-up call on Sundays.

The run itself was about 7.5km and there was a ton of people out walking, running, rollerblading, biking, etc. I went out super hard (3m20s through 1km, 7m through 2km) but managed to get things back under control. I was expecting a 10km run which is a bit beyond what I have been running so the 7 or 8km it turned out being was good. I&#8217;ve been trying to run consistent sub 4min pace and managed to do that today.

After the run, the local supermarket conglomerate was supplying free pancakes, sausages, oranges, banana&#8217;s and sunny d. I haven&#8217;t had sunny d in years but it was the only stuff around so I forced a couple glasses in.

Now the rest of the day will be spent relaxing and setting up my new Dell D610 laptop.
