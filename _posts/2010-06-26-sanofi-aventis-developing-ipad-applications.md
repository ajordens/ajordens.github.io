Was just glancing through the ***New and notable*** list of iPad applications and noticed **[GoMealsHD][1]**.

> Powered by the CalorieKing nutritional database, GoMeals allows you to search thousands of foods and dishes from popular restaurants, grocery stores and the items you have in your own kitchen to easily see the nutritional value (i.e. calories, carbohydrates, fats, protein, etc.) of the foods you eat. You may also track your daily food intake by saving food items to your "Today&#8217;s Plate" on the application&#8217;s calendar. You can monitor each day&#8217;s caloric intake, as well as the distribution of carbs, fats, and proteins. If you&#8217;re going out to eat, use the restaurant locator to easily find restaurants nearby and browse their menu and the nutritional information for the menu items to help support the best choices for you. Everything you need to develop a more nutritious eating plan is in one easy application.

It doesn’t look like it’s a particularly new app ([press release][2]) but it’s just now graced the New and notable list.&#160; Should likely receive a healthy bump in # of users.

&#160;

It may seem strange for a pharmaceutical giant like Sanofi to be developing iOS applications (*motivations?*), but it does look like an interesting health outreach project on the company’s part.&#160; 

There’s even a twitter account for the application ([gomeals][3]).

&#160;

Here’s hoping they make special note of the so-called *death on a bun* [Ultimate Grilled Cheeseburger Melt][4] (*1500+ calories, ~100g fat and more sodium than you can shake a fist at*).
