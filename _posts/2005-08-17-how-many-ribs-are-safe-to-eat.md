I bet it&#8217;s some number less than 30&#8230;

Tonight was the night I had spent the last year waiting for, **All you can eat rib night** at the neighborhood Montana&#8217;s Cookhouse Saloon (bonus points because it&#8217;s called a saloon). We bought a disposable camera half-way through and should have pictures posted on Flickr later this week.

**The Story:**  
For the better part of the past 9 months, Glenn and I have been talking about going for all you can eat ribs. The original plan called for us to don white t-shirts, make a mess of them with ribs, and finish the night off with a Victoria Salmon Kings hockey game. The original plan didn&#8217;t pan out, and with Glenn leaving next week for England, we had to act fast. No post-food festivities, but we did manage to spend 3hours in the restaurant.

**Who Attended:**

  * Frank
  * Glenn (aka. &#8220;Look guys I&#8217;m a wolly mamath&#8221;)
  * Dave
  * Shaun
  * Mike
  * Courtney
  * Felice
  * Sonja
  * Glenn
  * Me

Not a bad turnout, and for the amount of ribs injested, not a bad deal at $275. 

I&#8217;m happy to say that Glenn, Dave and myself didn&#8217;t fake the funk and went for the full on back ribs. It was an amazing sight, seeing mounds and mounds of bones piled up on the plates. The final bone tally had me polishing off 30 ribs, not too bad. Together, the three of has had 19 second orders of ribs.

The disappointment of the night was that I didn&#8217;t have a white t-shirt to wear. I was all talk and didn&#8217;t perform, sorry guys. 

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve eaten this much in my life. Tomorrow might be trouble.

**Morning After Update:** 

Adam: I must say I&#8217;ve felt better in the morning, but like the song says I will survive.  
Frank: &#8216;Man I feel pretty sick right now. Stupid ribs.&#8217;  
Glenn: &#8220;I have a rib hangover. I feel helly bad&#8221;  
Dave: &#8220;I gained 2 kilo&#8217;s&#8221;

1 pig = 26 ribs, so basically we&#8217;re all oink oink.
