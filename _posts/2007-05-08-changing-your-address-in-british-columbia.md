I&#8217;ve recently moved and just happened across the Provincial Governments [Change of Address Service][1].

> *In the fall of 2000 the Government of British Columbia started a project to develop a new service that would allow BC residents to provide their change of address information to one point of contact with the provincial government and have the information forwarded to multiple programs on their behalf.*

It claims to be able to update ICBC and the Provincial Medical Services Plan so I gave it a shot. I should learn in 4 or 5 weeks time if everything was successful.

Reading down the page a bit further it states that ICBC and MSP came on as part of Phase 1&#8230; in 2001. It was expected that other Crown corporations and public services would be brought on in subsequent phases. Having worked in government contracting in the past, it&#8217;s not really a suprise to see it still stagnant at phase 1 but funny nonetheless. Our tax dollars at work.

If it works I&#8217;ll be happy.
