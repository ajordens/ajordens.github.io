On a whim tonight I decided to investigate [Bloglines][1]. 

**Background:**  
I read blogs in two locations, work and home. In a perfect world, I&#8217;d like the ability to synchronize my read lists between each site. It&#8217;s a heterogeneo  
us environment with linux on one side and windows on the other.

By using bloglines i&#8217;ve been able to import my list of 70 or 80 odd blogs that I actively read. I normally use SharpReader for reading on my windows box b  
ut decided to try out FeedDemon because of its integration with Bloglines. 

I&#8217;m hoping that the Bloglines web interface will be a suitable replacement for liferea (my rss reader in Debian). When I get home, i&#8217;ll be able to fire u  
p FeedDemon and only see posts that haven&#8217;t been read at all. It will take some getting used to but looks like it could be a pretty good solution.

On another note, I&#8217;ve been experimenting with [Synergy][2] on my  
dual head system at home. Although I&#8217;ve got a hardware kvm to switch one of the two displays between a linux and windows machine, Synergy allows me to do  
something similar in software over tcp/ip. It&#8217;s a slick solution where I can just move my mouse cursor off the screen and onto the second machines deskto  
p. The best part is that you can cut&#038;paste text between the two machines.

Pretty cool if you ask me.
