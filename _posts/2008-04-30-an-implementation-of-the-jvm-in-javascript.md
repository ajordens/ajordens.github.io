Caught this over on JavaPosse Google Groups.

  Essentially, some bright fellows over in Japan have developed a bytecode->javascript compiler. There&#8217;s a demo floating around that took a Tetris (persumably AWT) implementation and has it running as Javascript in the browser.

  <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/running-java-in-javascript/">John Resig</a> has the best overview of it that I&#8217;ve seen so far. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://ejohn.org/files/orto.pdf">PDF</a> as well if you happen to read Japanese.

  I don&#8217;t know the fundamentals of what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes with their compiler so I can&#8217;t comment on how similar this is to what the GWT folk have been doing. Nonetheless, the demo is pretty slick and the concept interesting.
