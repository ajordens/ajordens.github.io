I&#8217;ve spent the past week on the eastern coast, notably Philadelphia and Boston (Cambridge to be exact).

Now the weather wasn&#8217;t so great when I left Victoria so I was looking forward to the possibility of something a little nicer on the other coast. Boy was I  
wrong, the weather back home has sky-rocketed to 25-30 degrees celsius, and I&#8217;ve been stuck here suffering through 6 days of rain and wind.

The good news is I finally have a nice day of weather. Bad news is, it&#8217;s the last day and I fly out this afternoon. It&#8217;s also been difficult to keep up o  
n reading my blogs this trip. You would think there would be lots of time to sit around and read, but not really in reality.

Oh well, you win some you loose some. At least my new camera will have arrived when I get back home.

On another note, I&#8217;m hoping to have some time to update my blogs L&#038;F. I&#8217;m running a slightly dated release of movabletype so I may upgrade that or try som  
ething different, depending on how adventerous I&#8217;m feeling. At the very least, I&#8217;m driven by a desire to present an aggrevated view of my photos.
