[Proudly Serving My Corporate Masters: Top Ten Favorite Spots on the Microsoft Campus][1]

Never been there myself, although I have been meaning to visit a friend of mine who has been working there for the past couple years. The above link is MS  
employee Adam Barr&#8217;s top ten favourite (I&#8217;m cdn) places on campus.

Looks like a nice place to work, I enjoy some sembelence of nature and do get a bit of it at my current place of employment (the [Vancouver Island Technology Park][2]). Not quite on the same scale but the chickens and horses I drive by on the way into work must be worth somethin
