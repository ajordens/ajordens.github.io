[Top 5 Attributes of Highly Effective Programmers][1]

I&#8217;ve always found it interesting to read others thoughts on what makes us effective. If you haven&#8217;t read it already, I&#8217;d recommend it.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ben&#8217;s List</span>

  * Humility
  * Love of Learning
  * Detail-orientedness
  * Adaptability
  * Passion

Personally, I think it&#8217;s a pretty good list. High level and applicable to most situations in life, not just programming.

If I could add a 6th, it would certainly be <span style="font-style: italic;">communication</span>. As was mentioned in one of the comments, nothing can mess a team up faster than poor communication. We&#8217;ve all seen it and should be trying to avoid seeing it again.

It&#8217;s also important to note that balance is very important. I&#8217;ve known plenty of effective people that have been able to achieve separation between their personal lives and the demands of the job.
