**Summer is here.**

Things have been pretty busy for the past month or so and as such I&#8217;ve decided to take a quick jaunt to Kelowna. Family and friends there so it&#8217;s a good opportunity to relax and unwind.

Although it looks like the west coast rain we got this week is going to be following me inland. Here&#8217;s hoping that we see a return to the mid 35 degree celsius weather.

For the first time in awhile, the plan is to leave the laptop behind and completely unplug. We&#8217;re in the midst of some interesting conversations surrounding project resources so it&#8217;s a good opportunity to get away. With any luck, when I get back to the office next week I&#8217;ll be able to switch right back into new product development mode and have a (*small*) team of developers to help me out.

Cheers.
