I&#8217;ve decided to go out on a limb here and make the switch from MovableType to WordPress. Not really a slight against MovableType, but I&#8217;ve been meaning to upgrade my blogging software for sometime and liked the theme support available with WordPress.

The migration was rather straight forward. My hosting company, 1&#038;1, provided everything I needed to make the switch. MovableType made it easy to export my existing blog posts &#038; comments and WordPress provided support out of the box for importing the data. I&#8217;ve noticed there are some odd paragraph breaks that have occured as an artifact of the export &#038; import, I&#8217;m not about to manually go through and fix all them so my web readers will have to live with it.

I did actually experiment with a bunch of different themes, but came back to stock Kubrick with a replaced header image. I like the looks of it and who knows, might stick with it for awhile. The built-in theme support makes it trivial to tweak the blogs look and feel.

Lastly, I installed the [flickrRSS][1] plug-in which allowed me to easier place thumbnail photographs in my sidebar. So far I&#8217;m happy with the functionality provided by WordPress. I will be experimenting with the anti-spam tools because I&#8217;m being hit with an ever increasing amount of comment spam. It&#8217;s gotten to the point where I actually have gotten into the habit of disabling comments.

The only other thing of note I did this evening was install a Personal edition of [Confluence][2]. *Confluence, the professional J2EE wiki, is a knowledge management tool designed to make it easy for a team to share information with each other, and with the world.* I thought I&#8217;d give Confluence a try since they just came out a perpetually free personal license. We use JIRA at work for bug tracking and have had nothing but praise for it. Before Confluence, I&#8217;d been using the ruby instiki. It was a relatively lightweight wiki that worked well on my laptop. I&#8217;ve installed Confluence on my linux server so I may still have use for instiki for simple note taking on this portable.

That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s all.
