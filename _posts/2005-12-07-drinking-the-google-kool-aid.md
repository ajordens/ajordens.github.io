I would argue it&#8217;s not just a book selling site, it&#8217;s **the** book selling site. When I want to buy I book, I&#8217;ll always buy from them. I&#8217;ve had good experiences with Amazon in the past and I see no reason the change my buying habits. 

I don&#8217;t know how many others share the same belief, but I&#8217;m probably not in the minority.

> With Yahoo now equal in search quality and MSN and AskJeeves equal within months or a year at most, the division of advertising revenues will challenge Google, making it hard to grow faster than the rate offline advertising money pours online.

Likewise with search, when I want to do a search, I&#8217;ll always do it in Google and it&#8217;s going to take a lot to get me to change. I&#8217;m not really a person who runs the search first in google and than runs the same search in msn/yahoo. If I don&#8217;t find what I need in Google, I move on and/or re-search with a more exact/broad search query. 

I haven&#8217;t really dealved much into the localized aspects of each search engine but I do see that as a potentially differentiating quality. It&#8217;s still relatively new and seemingly a good source of innovation.
