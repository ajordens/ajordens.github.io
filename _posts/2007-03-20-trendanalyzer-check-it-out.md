I&rsquo;m sure most of you have heard by now of Google&rsquo;s acquisition of [Gapminder&rsquo;s][1] Trendalyzer software.

Gapminder is a Stockholm-based foundation so it looks like the Trendalyzer development team will be moving to Mountain View with the foundation itself remaining in Sweden.

I&rsquo;d never actually heard of Trendalyzer until now.&nbsp;

Over the past couple months, statistics and data visualization has become much more of a personal interest.&nbsp; From a personal perspective,&nbsp;Tendalyzer is&nbsp;a pretty cool tool independent of the potential business value it brings to a company like Google.

Having spent 5 minutes on Google&rsquo;s [site][2], it looks promising.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a given that they&rsquo;ll be an integration with Google&rsquo;s existing web analytics stuff but I&rsquo;d love to see the *basic* trends in Google Reader improved as well.

Basically Trendalyzer provides a way of presenting data and statistics with simple time-lapse animation.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s available now is mostly population data plotable in various *X vs. Y *forms (w/ a 3<sup>rd</sup> dimension being represented by color).&nbsp; For example, you could plot &lsquo;Physicians per 1000 people&rsquo; vs. &lsquo;Life expectancy, years&rsquo; and follow the progression over the last few decades for any number of countries.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s just the beginning.

The ability to track multiple variables (countries and various other indicators)&nbsp;presented some interesting statistics.&nbsp; I certainly didn&rsquo;t know that the life expectancy of Malawi&nbsp;(randomly chosen country)&nbsp;residents decreased by almost 5 years between 1993 and 2003 w/ the # of physicians per 1000 people also dropping from 0.026 to 0.011.&nbsp; Compare that with Canada&rsquo;s constant 2.1 physicians per 1000 people (in 1993 and 2003) and life expectancy change of +1 years over the same time period.

Take India, since 1960 the life expectancy has increased from 44 years to 63 years.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been a 3x increase in physicians per capital over the same time period&hellip; 0.21 -> 0.6&hellip;
