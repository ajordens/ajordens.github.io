Just sitting in the terminal waiting to board the flight for seattle.

Internet access cost $7.95 for 24 hours, of which I&#8217;ll only use about an hour and a half. Nonetheless, its allowed me to get caught up on a few blogs and  
pass the time quicker than if I was just sitting in the chair or drinking a beer in the restaurant.

Next stop Seattle in 6hours, we&#8217;ll see if I can find internet access there.

Cheers.
