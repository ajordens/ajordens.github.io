Finally got an invitation to [Pownce][1] this afternoon.

> **<u>What is it?</u>**

> Pownce is a way to send messages, files, links, and events to your friends. You&#8217;ll create a network of the people you know and then you can share stuff with all of them, just a few of them, or even just one other person really fast.

It&#8217;s Kevin Rose&#8217;s (from digg.com and whatnot) new thing. I&#8217;ll play with it over the next few days and see how it works. If anyone out there would like an invitation drop me a line, or leave a comment. If you&#8217;re already have an account, you should add me as a friend :).

From what I&#8217;ve seen, Pownce has a fairly intutitive UI and I&#8217;m particularly interested in trying out it&#8217;s desktop component. The desktop app leverages Adobe new AIR (Apollo) framework.
