Mark Cuban has a [post][1] reflecting on times past and how future generations will one day be considering 2005 to be the good ole days. 

Now if you ask me whats the best console ever made, I&#8217;ll probably say the original Nintendo. Try to get to play a nintendo game now (via emulation of course), not a chance. Times have changed and while we all think about the past, very few of us would want to go back. That&#8217;s what drives innovation. Like Mark says, *the smart ignore the reminiscing about the good ole days and focus on creating unique and improved experiences*.
