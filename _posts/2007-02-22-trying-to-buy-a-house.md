A couple weeks back I decided it was time to \_try\_ and enter the real estate market.  If you don&#8217;t know Victoria, it&#8217;s a fairly desirable west coast city to live in with not a lot of options when it comes to affordable housing.  Average price for a house is easily ~400k+ and the townhouses/condos I&#8217;ve been looking at have been in to ~300k range, and that&#8217;s in the suburbs.

I&#8217;ve had limited success so far but have finally gotten to the point of making offers and battling over counter-offers.  It&#8217;s very much a game, not unlike fighting with Product Management over requirements, scope and resources.  With any luck it&#8217;ll be over soon and I&#8217;ll have a nice home office to work from.

The real estate agents <span style="font-weight: bold">will surely</span> make out alright, a $300,000 sale would gross $12,000 in fees and I can&#8217;t imagine either the buying or selling agent having much in the way of costs.
