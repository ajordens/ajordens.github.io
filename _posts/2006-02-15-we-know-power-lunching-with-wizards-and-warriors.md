<a target="_blank" href="http://joi.ito.com">Joi</a> just sent me a link to a CNET News article about our WoW (World of Warcraft, yes&#8230; that mmorpg) guild.

The world of online gaming is interesting in that it attracts a very diverse set of individuals. Not only do we have fairly high profile and successful tech entrepeneurs, we&#8217;ve also got numerous parent/children combinations as well. Sure we&#8217;ve all got our ego&#8217;s, but in general everyone&#8217;s committed to the enjoyment of the game with networking being a nice side-effect.

There&#8217;s also a story (*Is World of Warcraft the New Golf?*) with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147826">1UP</a> that tells tales of Joi and his many online and offline conquests. Even mentions our brief &#8216;Khadgar Sucks&#8217; compaign to get people to change servers so that our homeland wouldn&#8217;t be so laggerific.
