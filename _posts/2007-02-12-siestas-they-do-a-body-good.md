Noticed an interesting CBC [article][1] discussing the benefits of siestas on heart health. Supposedly the benefits are even more pronounced in males.

Now it would be next to impossible to have such a thing in my current office situation but at least I&#8217;m fortunate enough to be able to spend my lunch hour working out at the gym. Foosball tables aren&#8217;t a bad office accessory either.

It&#8217;s amazing the impact that stress can have on your ability to work effectively. Therefore I think it&#8217;s critical to get out of the office and recharge. If you&#8217;re like Intuit and have nap facilities, more power to you. Otherwise, go outside and enjoy the sun.
