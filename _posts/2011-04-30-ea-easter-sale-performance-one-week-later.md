A quick follow-up to the [post][1] from earlier this week.

  * [iPad Chart and Data][2]
  * [iPhone Chart and Data][3]

 

There&#8217;s still some actual analysis to be done but you can clearly see the state of EA&#8217;s applications before, during and after the sale.

It was definitely a winning move for EA.

At the height of the sale, EA had more than 20 iPhone apps appearing in the Top 100.  Prior to the sale starting, there were only 10.  Today, 4 or 5 days after the sale ended, there are 12.

The true impact is better measured on the Top Grossing charts.

For a better idea of what those impacts were, checkout Electronic Arts on [Appiity][4].
