There&#8217;s an [interesting article][1] on Wired detailing the significant search for computing pioneer Jim Gray, lost at sea since January.

> He was intense, I was intense, and we were both raised by single parents. Jim was like a mountain man who was also a brilliant scientist.&#8221; She liked to call him Mr. Database. *(from Wired)*

For those that don&#8217;t recognized the name, see Jim&#8217;s [Wikipedia][2] page. Jim *is/was* nothing short of a computing legend and many billions of personal worth have resulted from his contributions to database and transaction processing systems.

It&#8217;s truely amazing to what lengths the searchers went, it&#8217;s unfortunate that more progress wasn&#8217;t made.
