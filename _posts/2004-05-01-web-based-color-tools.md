[LaughingMeme: Web Based Color Tools][1]

A short list of some extremely useful web-based utilities that can be used to help choose visually pleasing color schemes. 

I&#8217;m not an artist by any means, and it&#8217;s little tools like this that help developers like me build nice looking online (and offline) applications. Of cour  
se if you already have graphic training or an artist on staff, you probably have less of a need for these utilities.
