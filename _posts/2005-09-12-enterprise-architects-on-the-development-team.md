Rebecca Parsons has written an article advocating that successful Enterprise Architects should consider joining the development teams they&#8217;re working with.

*Enterprise Architecture groups often get separated from day to day development. This can lead to their knowledge of development work getting out of date and development teams not taking a broad company-wide perspective. Having seen this happen frequently Rebecca argues that enterprise architects can be much more effective by joining development teams.*

I think her arguments are well formulated and I agree with them for the most part. There is a certain degree of accountability required from both development and architectural teams, accountability that has a tendency to get lost or shuffled if there is too many organizational layers in between. It has been my experience that an architect garners far more respect when he&#8217;s down in the trenches.
