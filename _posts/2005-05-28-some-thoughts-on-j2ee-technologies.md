Just happened across this [blog post][1] where the question is posed: 

*&#8220;can the rate the market pays per hour to developers be a measure of technology&#8217;s complexity?&#8221;*

My take on this is, yes and no. Obviously the more complicated and in-depth the technology (or at least the application of it) is, the more any consultant  
in his right mind is going to demand. 

He talks about the complexities of EJB, now I disagree that EJB itself is a particularily challenging technology, its more the components and inter-relati  
onships of the entire J2EE framework that are difficult to apply correctly. 

With regards to JDO consultants being able to charge more, I imagine this is solely because there are not enough JDO consultants to satisfy the demand. If  
it ever were to displace the traditional EJB model of enterprise development, you may see the consultant fee&#8217;s reversed with a lack of core J2EE/EJB exper  
ts and a large base of JDO consultants. 

In general, the more obscure the technology, the more you&#8217;ll end up paying in consulting fees.

Just my 2 cents before I jump on a plane.
