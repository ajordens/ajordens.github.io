But I cheated.

Work has been extremely busy the past few months and I haven&#8217;t had much time to anything, let alone read blogs.

I&#8217;ve steadily watched my unread count rise to 1000,2000,3000,4000 and finally 5k unread posts.  I&#8217;ve periodically knocked it back a bit but haven&#8217;t been able to put a substantial dent into it.

Tonight it was at 4200 and I finally hit the bullet and flushed it.  I read what looked immediately interesting and skipped over my less interesting subscriptions entirely.  It&#8217;s now sitting at 269 which is far more manageable and I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll be able to keep on top of it from this point on.

My public list of feeds can be found <a target="_blank" title="here" href="http://www.bloglines.com/public/AdamJordens">here</a>.  Mostly tech related but there&#8217;s a bit of stuff for everyone, which is probably what makes it difficult to keep up with.
