Honestly, I&nbsp;really don&rsquo;t care&nbsp;about new cell phones.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the guy walking down the street with the 4 year old dual color Samsung (yes, that&rsquo;s blue backlit and black text, no graphics here).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a tad scratched but it works.

All that being said, Telus Mobility&nbsp;did call&nbsp;me the other day and try to get me to buy a new phone.&nbsp; They offered $150 discount and I (supposedly) wouldn&rsquo;t even have to lock myself in to a plan.&nbsp; The trouble is&hellip; all their phones are boring.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t think of a single compelling reason to upgrade.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not just Telus either, every phone I&rsquo;ve seen in Canada is boring.

Maybe if they had the new Helio [phone][1]?

Too bad it&rsquo;s not (and won&rsquo;t be?) available in Canada.
