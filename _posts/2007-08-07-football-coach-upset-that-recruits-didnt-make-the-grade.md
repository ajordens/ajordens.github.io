I went to school in [Canada][1] so we didn&#8217;t any of the controversy that&#8217;s currently brewing down at S. Carolina.

Their football coach, Steve Spurrier, is [upset][2] because two of his recruits were not admitted to the University based on their academic standing. The University managed to deny them admission despite them satisfying the NCAA minimum requirements.

I agree with the stance taken by the University and question why this is even getting air time. It&#8217;s very rare to see a student athlete turn pro and make a decent living, far more often these athletes finish their 4 or 5 years of eligibility and join the working world like the rest of us. The University would be doing them a disservice by not emphasizing academics. Further to that, there is the possibility for penalties (in the form of lost scholarships) if athletes drop out prior to completing their degree. 

***The following was a comment from the ESPN article (every other comment was in favor of the action, this one wasn&#8217;t):***

> Who cares what their GPA and test scores are. They chose the school to play football and not for their academics. I think that college admissions criteria for athletes should change. If an athlete chooses to go to a university for a sport, then that sport should be the major with their own admissions requirements (college of athletics). On the other hand, if an athlete does choose a &#8216;regular&#8217; major then he/she should be held to the same academic standards that non-athletes for that major are held to. Having an athlete be held to an academic standard is like having a computer nerd squat 600lbs or practice with the football team (ain&#8217;t gonna happen even if you could get him out of his mom&#8217;s basement).

*Funny stuff. * [Latest news][3] has South Carolina stating that it&#8217;s willing to work with Spurrier but is not prepared to re-write the admissions rule book to do so. Nor should it.
