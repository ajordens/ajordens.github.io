Great article about Steve Jobs and John Sculley.

[Business Week][1]

The article mentions (*a number of times*) Jobs&#8217; obsession of starting with the point of user interaction and working backwards.

**Strong agreement from me there**.

The idea of Sony wanting to dominate electronic components before moving forward to products is analogous to **building the backend without any thought of what the UI and user experience is going to be**.
