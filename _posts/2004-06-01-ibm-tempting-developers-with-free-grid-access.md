[IBM tries the lure of free grid acces  
s &#8211; News &#8211; ZDNet][1]

According to ZDNet, *IBM is hoping to recruit developers by offering free access to high-powered grid computing servers over the Internet.*

I don&#8217;t know how much access you could ever get, or for how long, but it might be something worth checking out if you are interested in grid-technologies a  
nd don&#8217;t have the time or the bother to setup your own environment. Alternatively, if you are involved in GRID-enabled application development and haven&#8217;t  
ran it on IBM software, now&#8217;s your chance.

If you want to start building your own grid-enabled applications, there is always the [Globus Framework][2]. I did some GR  
ID work with Globas some six months ago and it was fairly interesting, a technology that I think is a bit ahead of it&#8217;s time for most applications but some  
thing worth keeping in the back of your mind nonetheless.
