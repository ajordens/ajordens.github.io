Well, the much anticipated (to me at least) [Google Calendar][1] went live today.

My first impression, Wow!

As expected it has a dead simple user interface and I was able to import my exported calendars (from Outlook) with no problems. It schedules daily tasks with a simple click-drag, and multi-day/repeatable events are a simple property change away. It&#8217;s got integration with Google Maps, although none of my imported events actually have address information in them.

Enough said, you should check it out.
