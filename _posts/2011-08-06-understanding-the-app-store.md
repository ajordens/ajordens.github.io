I&#8217;ve been working on tools to better understand the app store, they&#8217;ve been made available as part of [Appiity][1].

My underlying motivation is to try and help developers make better sense of the app store (different categories, countries, competitors, etc.). It&#8217;s also scratching a personal itch of mine around application discovery by providing a historical performance context around each application.

I&#8217;m looking for feedback and to engage with more developers.

 

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key Features</span>**:

  * 30 day trailing performance for any ranked application (actually have > 12 months worth of data but am only actively exposing a months worth)
  * top paid / free / grossing chart positions vs. pricing (measure the actual impact of a price adjustment on gross position)
  * ratings per app per version (what impact does releasing new versions have on chart positions)
  * apps per developer (how are all the apps from a particular developer currently or historically performing)
  * iPhone/iPad/Mac app tracking

 

If you&#8217;ve published an application or are actively developing one, I&#8217;d like to hear your thoughts. I&#8217;m quite passionate about helping developers better understand their target market/competitors, and this is my first attempt at addressing some immediate needs.

If you&#8217;re looking for an alternative way to discover quality applications, I&#8217;d encourage you to check it out as well. I&#8217;ve found the historical performance of an application and it&#8217;s developer to be a good indicator of it&#8217;s quality. We all know that dropping your price certainly doesn&#8217;t improve the quality of your app and yet it often can boost your ranking.
