Caught this over on [techcrunch][1].

I actually had the [akismet][2] wordpress plugin installed for a long time but hadn&#8217;t gotten around to enabling it until now. I forgot I had a wordpress.com account and it needs a wordpress.com API key to function.

Either way, it&#8217;s active now and right away caught 30 comment spams. I&#8217;ve got ~3600 comments awaiting moderation right now and I suspect that ~99% of them are spam. It&#8217;s gotten to the point where I don&#8217;t even care to wade through the mess and manually moderate.

By all accounts Akismet works wonders. Provided you don&#8217;t make a lot of money off your blog, it&#8217;s completely free to use and dead simple to install. System-wide statistics are available [here][3]. 53,932 approved messages today, 1,370,133 rejected spam messages today.
