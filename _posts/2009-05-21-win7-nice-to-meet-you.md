I hate to admit it but I’ve been running Vista on a desktop machine at home for the better part of the past 8 months.

It has not been a terrible experience (*High-end dual-core with 8 gigs of ram does help*) but I’ve been looking for more.

I’ve heard good things about Win7, and with the recent release of the RC, decided to upgrade.

&#160;

I must say the process was quite painless and almost everything worked out of the box.&#160; We just got a new SonicWALL Firewall/VPN at work and the client had to be re-installed.&#160; Other than that, a minor tweak to the [command-line parameters for Chrome][1] and I was off to the races.

YMMV but I’ve seen a noticeable improvement in my day-to-day activities on the machine.&#160;
