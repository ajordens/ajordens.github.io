I just got my email about registering for the Riya beta.

Don&#8217;t know what [Riya][1] is?

> Basically some next generation face recognition software that will eventually provide a more efficient and effective way of searching and indexing photographs (that&#8217;s my take on it, it may or may not jive with Riya&#8217;s true mission)

My first impression is that it&#8217;s sort of flickr&#8217;ish.  There is a desktop uploader (written in Java) that allows you to select and upload your images.  Once uploaded, you manually train the recognition on your image set using a fairly intuitive (and simple for the time being) web interface.  
The manual training asks you for a full name and email address for each recognized face, I haven&#8217;t looked farther but I wonder if it supports training across users (ie. I say someone looks like Adam Jordens (my.email@address.com) and someone else says the same thing, is the software smart enough to know its the same person).

Eventually I&#8217;m guessing it would be, but for the time being, Riya is as smart as a 2-year old.  It&#8217;s up to us to upload content and help the training progress.  I encourage you all to get in on the beta and give it a shot.  I&#8217;ll write a follow-up post in a few days once I&#8217;ve had time to upload more images and better test the system.
