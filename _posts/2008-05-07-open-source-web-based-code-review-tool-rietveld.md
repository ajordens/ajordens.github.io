Guido van Rossum, of Python fame, has recently released a Django-based application that enables web-based code reviews&#8230; [Rietveld][1].

It supports any language and currently can hook into Subversion repositories. You can see it [running][2] on Google AppEngine. Check it out!

Personally, I&#8217;m a big fan of [Atlassian Crucible][3] and have quickly come to realize the benefits of doing both on-line (in person) and off-line (web-based) code reviews.
