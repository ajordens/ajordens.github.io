The Harvard University Gazette has posted a transcript of BillG&#8217;s [commencement speech][1].

It carries an important and motivating message with some self-deprecating humour thrown in for good measure (see below :)).

*Imagine, just for the sake of discussion, that you had a few hours a week and a few dollars a month to donate to a cause &#8211; and you wanted to spend that time and money where it would have the greatest impact in saving and improving lives. Where would you spend it?*

This message particularly rings home. I was involved with the 2nd annual Canary (*Soap Box*) Derby held this past weekend in Victoria, BC. It was held in support of the [Canary Foundation][2], who shares a vision of ***A world of simple blood tests which identify and isolate cancer at its earliest most curable stage**.* It&#8217;s amazing what communities of like minded people can accomplish when adequately motivated to work towards a common cause (in this case, raising $100k+ and purchasing a piece of equipment for the BC Cancer Agency). 

Obviously discovering a cure for cancer is society&#8217;s ultimate [BHAG][3], but there&#8217;s something about *a simple blood test* that makes it both an attainable and stretch goal. Attainable in the sense that a blood test to many is just a fact of life, yet we haven&#8217;t (yet) discovered or validated any appropriate markers in our blood that are positively indicative of cancer). It&#8217;s important that there&#8217;s an ability to track progress towards a goal to help keep everyone involved (particularly the commercial entities) motivated.

*&#8230;*

*Radcliffe was a great place to live. There were more women up there, and most of the guys were science-math types. That combination offered me the best odds, if you know what I mean. This is where I learned the sad lesson that improving your odds doesn&#8217;t guarantee success. &#8211; Bill Gates*
