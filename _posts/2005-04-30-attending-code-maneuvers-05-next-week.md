I think I&#8217;ve only been in town for 2 weeks out of the past month. Long story but I&#8217;ve been in Washington D.C. and Boston visiting clients and participatin  
g in trade shows. Luckily I balanced those trips out with a 2 week trip to the Mayan Riveria.

We have 5 new employees starting next week and have decided a good kick-off event would be to attend Sun&#8217;s [Code Maneuvers 05][1] conference in Vancouver. 

*This full day event highlights state-of-the-art intelligence about Sun&#8217;s software technologies, strategies and development methodologies.*

I hope that its not too influenced by Sun&#8217;s beliefs on technology trends and whats hot vs. whats not. However, I won&#8217;t hold my breath.

There are a few interesting topics, in particular persistence and j2ee/j2se performance which I&#8217;ll be checking out. The performance session is an actual c  
odecamp(??) which means its 1.5hrs long and could be worthwhile. The other sessions will probably end up being quick 45minute overviews unfortuantely.

I&#8217;ll report back if the event ends up being any good.
