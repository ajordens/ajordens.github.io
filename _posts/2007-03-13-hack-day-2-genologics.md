  This coming Friday GenoLogics will be hosting its first <a href="http://www.hackday.org/">Hack Day</a>&nbsp;of 2007 (and second overall).&nbsp; As with the previous event, it&rsquo;s internally focused with me serving as the organizer aka. the <em>person who ends up doing the prize shopping.&nbsp; </em>

  Our company has been fairly receptive and has even&nbsp;committed to&nbsp;4 hack days a year (roughly scheduled by quarters).&nbsp; There were some initial concerns over how these days would impact our 3 week development iterations but sanity eventually won out.&nbsp; If our schedule was so tight that we couldn&rsquo;t spare a day, we&rsquo;d be in pretty bad shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;d be nice to think that we&rsquo;re not doing too badly.&nbsp;

  The company hasn&rsquo;t grown significantly over the past year (~50 people in total) so I would expect about ~20 people to participate.

  Our last hack day occurred in November and was somewhat limited to developer (and the odd Product Manager) participation.&nbsp; This time around there&rsquo;s been enough interest from other departments that the CEO has asked that everyone be included <em>(not that anyone was being excluded previously, it was just marketed more towards coders).</em>
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  The schedule is looking as follows:
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  8:00 &ndash; 8:30&nbsp;: Start
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  12:00 &ndash; 1:00 : Lunch Break (pizza provided)
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  3:45 &ndash; 4:00 : Finish
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  4:00 &ndash; 5:00 : Demonstrations
</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  You can&rsquo;t help but notice there&rsquo;s not a lot of time actually set aside for coding.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re intense enough you could always take the pizza back to your desk.&nbsp; The last hour has been set aside for walking demonstrations (where everyone gathers around each desk and the&nbsp;coder spends a few minutes explaining their hack).&nbsp; We didn&rsquo;t even attempt to vote on hacks last time and likely won&rsquo;t this time either.&nbsp; Everybody does an excellent job and should have an equal opportunity to take a prize home.&nbsp;

  That&rsquo;s about it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll post some pictures and perhaps a movie next week.
