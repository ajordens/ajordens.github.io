I was originally planning on blogging about attracting top talent and the recent changes we&#8217;ve made to our hiring process&#8230;.but I&#8217;m in the process of drinking a tasty home-made smoothie and thought my time would be better spent singing the virtues of the [Magic Bullet][1]. Actually my buddy [Glenn][2] just blogged about making soup so I thought I&#8217;d try and one up him with something even easier.

The Magic Bullet is one of those silly &#8216;Seen On TV&#8217; products that has somehow managed to bridge the gap between 1-900 ordering and in-store purchasing. Truth be told I didn&#8217;t actually know it existed until my parents got me one this past Christmas.

I&#8217;ve only used it to make smoothies and I really don&#8217;t care if it can do anything else. It does one thing for me and it does it well&#8230; smoothies. So simple to make that I&#8217;ve probably had 6 or 7 of them in the week and a half since Christmas. Oh the novelty!

**What is it? **Really, it&#8217;s really nothing more than a small blender with a number of attachments that are geared towards making individually sized beverages, omelette&#8217;s, etc. It comes with a 101 recipes book but I haven&#8217;t cracked it and probably never will. I&#8217;m sure there are alternatives (in fact, I was at Home Depot over the weekend and they had some small blenders on sale) but I can&#8217;t speak for their quality or results.

My recommendation&#8230; do yourself a favor and go down to the nearest box store and ask for a Bullet, then head down to your neighborhood Costco and grab yourself a bag of frozen blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. If you&#8217;re feeling up to it, throw a kg or two of Chocolate protein powder in your basket. Go home and fill the plastic blending container ~3/4&#8217;s full of berries, throw in a scoop of protein powder, top it up with Cranberry juice and mix. ~20s later you&#8217;ve got yourself an awesome smoothie. Be prepared to suck, it&#8217;s quite thick but oh so tasty.
