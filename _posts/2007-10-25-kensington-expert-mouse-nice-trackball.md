![Kensington Expert Mouse][1]

First off, the [Kensington Expert Mouse][2] is an amazing trackball.  Of course, I guess the popularity of them has declined to the point where I wasn&#8217;t able to find one in any of the local computer stores.  Closest thing was the traditional Logitech thumb-based trackball, less than ideal.  The mouse is a gift to my dad and he wanted absolutely nothing of the Logitech.

None of the retailers (Futureshop, etc.) listed on the Kensington website listed the expert mouse, plenty of other Kensington gear but not many mice.  Amazon.com does sell them but of course won&#8217;t ship hardware to Canada.

[Ncix.com][3] also had them listed but as a special order item.  Have trackballs gone that much out of style?

To make a long story short, I&#8217;ve ordered it from [cdw.ca][4] and it should be shipped to my dad any day now.  If anyone else happens to be looking, don&#8217;t bother checking stores, just order it online.
