Came across this [site][1] tonight. Basically, it&#8217;s a community site for *Joel on Software *where readers can submit/vote on stories that would likely be of interest to fellow readers.

Normally I wouldn&#8217;t link to something like this, but I did read a few of the user-submitted posts and found them to be of fairly high value. I&#8217;ve found the signal-to-noise ratio in the blogosphere to be quite high as of late so it&#8217;s nice to have the community do a bit of filtering for you.

Check it out.

On that note, I&#8217;ve been struggling for weeks to get my unread posts in Bloglines down from 4k to something slightly more manageable&#8230; without much success. I&#8217;ve successfully gotten it down to 3k a number of times but than I go to JavaOne or something and it jumps to 4500.
