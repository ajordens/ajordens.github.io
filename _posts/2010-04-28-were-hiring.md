We’re looking for a few talented developers to join our ranks.

> GenoLogics is a leading provider of lab informatics solutions for translational research, with solutions crossing the clinical and discovery domains. GenoLogics focuses on providing best-in-class informatics solutions for genomics/next generation sequencing, proteomics, and biorepositories.

Traditionally we’re a strong Java / Groovy shop, so if the thought of living and working in lovely **Victoria, British Columbia **appeals to you. Let’s get in touch.

Relocation costs would likely be discussed if you’re an out of towner (*Seattle, Calgary, etc.*)

You can reach me at: **adam.jordens**** –**at- **genologics –**dot- **com**
