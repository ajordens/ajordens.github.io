I agree with Justin&#8217;s [post][1] regarding how easy (or pain-free) it is to do XUL development. I toyed around with it a month or so back and agree that it&#8217;s amazingly simple to develop something that presents well and for all intents and purposes behaves like a normal application. Kudo&#8217;s again to the Mozilla foundation.

For an organization with proven javascript abilities, its no wonder that Google was able to develop their Firefox toolbar efficiently with only a small team.

*For a small team that had never worked together, or used XUL, to create a product quickly that works across languages and platforms from a single ~250K download &#8211; that&#8217;s good stuff, if you ask me.*
