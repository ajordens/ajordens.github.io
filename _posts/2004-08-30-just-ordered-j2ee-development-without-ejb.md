J2EE with EJB&#8217;s (accessed from both a thin web client and thick desktop client) is what I do primary at work. However, for some time I&#8217;ve had an interest  
in light weight containers but have only had the opportunity to play with Spring briefly on a personal project. I am a fan of what Hibernate offers the de  
veloper (even if you&#8217;re only considering the query language vrs ejbql) and would like to understand it in a bit more detail. 

From all reviews, Rod&#8217;s book looks like a good read so I figured I&#8217;d pick it up and throw it on the queue. I don&#8217;t have much reading material on the go ri  
ght now, Code Complete 2.0 is the only thing I&#8217;ve been flipping through lately. Perhaps that will change now that summer is dieing down and the weather w  
on&#8217;t be as enticing&#8230;
