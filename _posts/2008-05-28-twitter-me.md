I&#8217;m been sufficiently busy at work since getting back from San Francisco and haven&#8217;t had much opportunity to blog.

As part of the JavaOne experience, I&#8217;ve taken another look at Twitter and have been using it as a quasi micro-publishing platform. It&#8217;s somewhat entertaining and the barrier to tweet is sufficiently lower.

Nothing too exciting and I hope to get back into the blogging train of thought shortly. I&#8217;ve got plenty to talk about from some recent experiences in the land of Seam (JPA, Facelets, etc.) and Maven.
